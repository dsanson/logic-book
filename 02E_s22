# Validity, Soundness, and Strength: Exercises

## Recognizing Validity and Soundness

::: standardform
| [Normal is a city in Illinois]{.premise .nn}
| [Chicago is a city in Illinois]{.premise .nn}
| [Illinois is in the Midwest]{.conclusion}
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
1 Are all the premises of this argument actually true?
| *Yes
| No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
2 Is the conclusion of this argument actually true?
| *Yes
| No
```


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
3 Is this argument valid?
| Yes
| *No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
4 Is this argument sound?
| Yes
| *No
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=4}
This argument has true premises and a true conclusion, but the
conclusion does not follow from the premises. More specifically, in terms
of our definition of validity, the premises could both be true, but the
conclusion false. 

To see this, imagine a possibility in which the premises are
true but the conclusion false. For example, imagine that US westward expansion ended in the early 19th
century, making the western border of Illinois the western border of the US.
So the conclusion is false. But suppose that, in this possible situation,
Chicago and Normal develop more or less the same way they actually did. So
both the premises are true.

Since the argument is not valid, it is not sound: to be sound, an argument
must both be valid AND have all true premises.

::: standardform
| [Normal is a city in Indiana]{.premise .nn}
| [Chicago is a city in Indiana]{.premise .nn}
| [Indiana is a state]{.premise .nn}
| [Normal and Chicago are both cities in the same state]{.conclusion}
:::


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
5 Are all the premises of this argument actually true?
| Yes
| *No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
6 Is the conclusion of this argument actually true?
| *Yes
| No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
7 Is this argument valid?
| *Yes
| No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
8 Is this argument sound?
| Yes
| *No
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=8}
This argument has a true conclusion, but its first two premises are false. But that
doesn't tell us whether or not it is valid. To figure that out, we need to
think about whether the conclusion *follows* from the premises, in the sense
defined by our definition of validity: is it *possible* for the premises to
all be true, but the conclusion false?

No, this is not possible: any possibility that makes it true that Normal and
Chicago are both cities in Indiana, and holds true the fact that Indiana is a
state, is also going to make it true that Normal and Chicago are cities in the
same state. So the argument is valid, because it is impossible for the
premises to all be true, but the conclusion false.

The argument is not sound, because it has false premises. In order for an
argument to be sound, it must both be valid AND have all true premises.

::: standardform
| [Biden is President]{.premise .nn}
| [If Biden is President, a Democrat is President]{.premise .nn}
| [A Democrat is President]{.conclusion}
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
9 Are all the premises of this argument actually true?
| *Yes
| No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
10 Is the conclusion of this argument actually true?
| *Yes
| No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
11 Is this argument valid?
| *Yes
| No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
12 Is this argument sound?
| *Yes
| No
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=12}
This argument is valid, and the premises are all true. So it is also sound.
:::

::: standardform
| [Trump is President]{.premise .nn}
| [If Trump is President, a Republican is President]{.premise .nn}
| [A Republican is President]{.conclusion}
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
13 Are all the premises of this argument actually true?
| Yes
| *No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
14 Is the conclusion of this argument actually true?
| Yes
| *No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
15 Is this argument valid?
| *Yes
| No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
16 Is this argument sound?
| Yes
| *No
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=16}
This argument is also valid. Notice that it has the same logical form as the
previous argument, about Biden. Arguments with this logical form are valid in
virtue of their form---that is, they are formally valid. But in this case, the
first premise is false. So the argument is not sound.
:::

::: standardform
| [A Democrat is President]{.premise .nn}
| [If Biden is President, a Democrat is President]{.premise .nn}
| [Biden is President]{.conclusion}
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
17 Are all the premises of this argument actually true?
| *Yes
| No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
18 Is the conclusion of this argument actually true?
| *Yes
| No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
19 Is this argument valid?
| Yes
| *No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
20 Is this argument sound?
| Yes
| *No
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=20}
This argument is not valid. Compare its form to the form of the previous two
arguments. Those arguments had this logical form:

::: standardform
| [$P$]{.premise .nn}
| [If $P$, $Q$]{.premise .nn}
| [$Q$]{.conclusion}
:::

This argument has a similar, but importantly different, logical form:

::: standardform
| [$P$]{.premise .nn}
| [If $Q$, $P$]{.premise .nn}
| [$Q$]{.conclusion}
:::

Arguments with first form are formally valid. Arguments with this second form
are not formally valid.

Do you see why the argument is not valid? Imagine that some other Democrat had
won the primary, and then won the election. Then the premises would both still
be true, but the conclusion would be false.
:::

::: standardform
| [Biden is President]{.premise .nn}
| [Biden is not President]{.premise .nn}
| [Grass is green]{.conclusion}
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
21 Are all the premises of this argument actually true?
| Yes
| *No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
22 Is the conclusion of this argument actually true?
| *Yes
| No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
23 Is this argument valid?
| *Yes
| No
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
24 Is this argument sound?
| Yes
| *No
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=24}
This is one of those degenerate cases of validity. The argument is valid
because it is impossible for both of the premises to be true together.

Note that arguments that are valid for this reason can never be sound, because
it can never be the case that all their premises are true.
