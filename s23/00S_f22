# Syllabus and Course Mechanics: Supplements

Many of units include supplements, like this. They are not required. They may
contain exercises, but not exercises that you can submit for credit. Nothing
here is worth any points. Nothing here can affect your grade.

So what's the point? If you've done all the exercises, and are still
struggling with the mastery check, the supplements might offer additional practice.
If you've done all the reading, and still find some concept or idea confusing,
the supplements might offer another slant on the same material.
