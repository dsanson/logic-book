Here is an especially difficult argument to translate adequately into PL:

> | I saw Esau kissing Kate,
> | The fact is we all three saw;
> | For I saw him,
> | And he saw me,
> | And she saw I saw Esau.

Give it a try.

:::soasticky
| F(x,y): x saw y
| G(x,y,z): x saw y kissing z
| H(x,y,z): x saw y seeing z
| a: me
| b: Esau (he/him)
| c: Kate (she/her)
:::

```{.Translate .FOL points=10}
25 G(a,b,c) : I saw Esau kissing Kate.
26 G(a,b,c)/\G(b,b,c)/\G(c,b,c) : We all three saw Esau kissing Kate.
27 F(a,b): I saw him.
28 F(b,a): He saw me.
29 H(c,a,b): She saw I saw Esau.
```

See the trouble? Our scheme of abbreviation provides us with three logically
unrelated predicates: F(x,y) expresses the two-place relation of someone 
seeing someone; G(x,y,z) expresses the three-place relation of someone seeing
someone kiss someone; and H(x,y,z) expresses the three-place relation of
someone seeing someone seeing someone.

But this can't be the right way to go about things. Seeing someone, and seeing someone
*kissing someone* and seeing someone *seeing someone* are all logically
related. For that matter, so is seeing someone *seeing someone kissing
someone*, and seeing someone *seeing someone seeing someone*, and seeing
someone *seeing someone seeing someone kissing someone* and so on.

Can you come up with a scheme of abbreviation that allows us to capture this?
Here are some ideas:

-   Both *kissing* and *seeing* are actions. Our scheme above doesn't capture
    this.
-   *Actions* have agents, but they also have objects. So maybe 'Esau kisses
    Kate' is an existential generalization: There is an action, it is a
    kissing, Esau is its agent, and Kate is its object.
-   Do you see people, or do you see actions? Or both? 'I saw Esau
    kissing Kate' appears to say not that you see Esau, but that you see *an
    action* that involves Esau as its agent and Kate as its object. Something like 'There is an action x, x is a seeing,
    I am x's agent, and there is another action y, y is a kissing, Esau is y's 
    agent, Kate is y's object, and y is the object of x.'
-   If the object of seeing can be an action, and seeing is an action, then
    the object of seeing can be another seeing! This should allow us to handle
    'She saw I saw Esau (kissing her)'.

| F(x): x is an action
| G(x): x is a kissing
| H(x): x is a seeing
| G(x,y): x is the agent of y
| H(x,y): x is the object of y
| a: me
| b: Esau (he/him)

:::

```{.Translate .FOL points=10}
30 Ex(F(x)/\G(x)/\G(b,x)/\H(c,x)) : Esau kisses Kate.
```

:::hint
Remember, the idea is that kissing is an action. So 'Esau kisses Kate' says
that there is an action, it is a kissing, Esau is its agent, and Kate is its
object.
:::

```{.Translate .FOL points=10}
31 Ex(F(x)/\H(x)/\G(a,x)/\Ey(F(y)/\G(y)/\G(b,y)/\H(c,y)/\H(y,x))) : I saw Esau kissing Kate.
```

:::hint
Remember, the idea is that seeing is an action that can have an action as its
object. So 'I saw Esau kissing Kate' says that there is an action, it is a
seeing, I am its agent, and there is an action, Esau is its agent, it is a
kissing, Kate is its object, and it is the object of my seeing.
:::

```{.Translate .FOL points=10}
32 Ex(F(x)/\H(x)/\G(c,x)/\Ey(F(y)/\H(y)/\G(a,y)/\Ez(F(z)/\G(z)/\G(b,z)/\H(z,y)/\H(y,x)))): She saw I saw Esau (kissing her).
```

:::hint
So, there is an action that is a seeing and Kate is the agent and there is an
action that is a seeing and I am the agent and there is an action that is a
kissing and Esau is the agent and Kate is the object, and the kissing is the
object of my seeing and my seeing is the object of Kate's seeing. Phew.

Question: Is the argument in the poem valid? I saw him (kissing Kate); He saw
me (seeing him kissing Kate); She saw me seeing him (kissing her). So each of
us saw *something*. But did we all see the *same* thing?

The classic work arguing that the underlying logical form of English
involves this sort of quantification over actions and events is:

-   Donald Davidson (1967) "[The logical form of action
    sentences](https://philpapers.org/rec/DAVTLF)." In Nicholas Rescher (ed.),
    The Logic of Decision and Action. University of Pittsburgh Press.
    pp.Â 81--95. (Also reprinted in his *Essays on Actions and Events*,
    Clarendon Press (1970).)

For a very clear and careful development of the idea that engages both with
Philosophy and Linguistics, see:

-   Terence Parsons (1990), *[Events in the Semantics of English: A Study in Subatomic
    Semantics](https://philpapers.org/rec/PAREIT)*. MIT Press.

Also, I first learned the 'I saw Esau' rhyme from this lovely book,
illustrated by Maurice Sendak (the author of *Where the Wild Things Are*):

-   Iona Opie (editor), Peter Opie (editor), Maurice Sendak (Illustrator)
   *I Saw Esau: The Schoolchild's Pocket Book*, Candlewick Press, 2000.

I especially adore Sendak's illustration of the old 'I one my mother, I two my
mother, etc.'
