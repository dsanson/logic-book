## Objectives

This chapter introduces logic and several key concepts used in the study of logic. The learning objectives for this unit are:

-   You know the definitions of each of the following technical terms:
    [logic]{.vocab}, [argument]{.vocab}, [premise]{.vocab},
    [conclusion]{.vocab}, [strength]{.vocab}, [validity]{.vocab}, [soundness]{.vocab}.
-   Given a short argumentative passage in English, you can use keywords like
    'since' and 'therefore' to identify premises and conclusions.
-   Given a short argument in standard form, you can evaluate it for validity
    and soundness.

## Introduction

[[Logic]{.vocab} is the business of evaluating arguments, sorting good ones from bad
ones.]{.def}

In everyday language, we sometimes use the word 'argument' to refer to
belligerent shouting matches. If you and a friend have an argument in this
sense, things are not going well between the two of you. But this is not the kind
of argument we study in logic.

The kind of argument we study in logic is a structured set of claims, meant to give
someone a reason to believe a conclusion. Here is an example.

:::standardform
-   It is raining.
-   When it rains, everyone outside without an umbrella gets wet.
-   You should take an umbrella when you go out. 
:::

The three dots, '∴', on the last line of each argument mean 'therefore'. They
indicate that the final sentence, "You should take an umbrella when you go
out," is the *conclusion* of the argument. The other two sentences are the
*premises* of the argument: together, they are meant to give you a reason to
believe the conclusion. Someone who makes this argument is saying that, if you
believe those premises, then you should believe that conclusion too.

So [an [argument]{.vocab} is a list of sentences. The last sentence in the
list, marked with '∴', is the [conclusion]{.vocab}. The other sentences are
the [premises]{.vocab}.]{.def}

Here is another example:

:::standardform
-   If you want a pet, you should either get a cat or a dog.
-   You are allergic to cats.
-   If you want a pet, you should get a dog.
:::

Again, the last sentence, marked by '∴', is the conclusion. The two sentences above are the
premises. The premises are meant to provide you with a reason to believe the
conclusion.

In some disciplines, the word 'argument' is used to mean the
thesis or main idea of an essay. Here is an example of this use:

> The argument of this essay is that the traditional bridges between the
> literary culture and the publishing culture have increasingly weakened, if
> not begun to collapse, in the past decade or so. (Ted Solotarnoff, "[The
> Publishing Culture and the Literary
> Culture](https://doi.org/10.1086/601440)." *The Library Quarterly* 54(1)
> 1984.

But this is not how we use the word "argument" in logic and philosophy. An
argumentative essay provides reasons in support of a conclusion. The
*argument* of the essay is the structured set of claims, consisting both of
those reasons, expressed as premises, and that conclusion, which is the thesis
of the essay.

## Good and Bad Arguments

Some arguments are pretty good, while others are pretty bad. The example we
began with is a pretty good argument:

:::standardform
-   It is raining.
-   When it rains, everyone outside without an umbrella gets wet.
-   You should take an umbrella when you go out. 
:::

If those premises are actually true, they do give you a pretty good reason to
believe the conclusion.

Here is an example of an argument that is pretty bad:

:::standardform
-   If you want a pet, you should get a cat or a dog.
-   You like cats.
-   You shouldn't get a dog.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
1   Can you explain why this argument is bad? That is, can you explain why, even if those premises are in fact true, they don't give you a good reason not to get a dog?
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=1}
There are many good answers to (1). Here one way to explain it: the fact that you like cats gives you a reason to get a cat. But it you might like dogs just as well, so it doesn't give you any reason to get a cat rather than a dog.
:::

We've already said that this is a pretty good argument:

:::standardform
-   It is raining.
-   When it rains, everyone outside without an umbrella gets wet.
-   You should take an umbrella when you go out. 
:::

But this argument is *better*:

:::standardform
-   It is raining.
-   When it rains, everyone outside without an umbrella gets wet.
-   If you go outside without an umbrella, you will get wet. 
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
2  Can you explain why the second argument is better than the first? (Hint: imagine that you sometimes enjoy a refreshing walk in the rain.)
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=2}
Again, there are many good answers to this question. Here is one way to explain it: suppose you *like getting wet*. Then the premises, if true, don't give you any reason to take an umbrella. But they do give you a reason to believe that, if you go outside without an umbrella, you will get wet. So for the first argument, it is *possible that the conclusion is false even though the premises are true*. But for the second argument, this is *impossible*. That means the second argument is better, because the premises offer a stronger *guarantee* of the truth of the conclusion.
:::

Wait, do you see that or not? It is way too easy to read something and accept
it, without thinking about it for yourself. So let me interrupt you, and, at the risk of asking you to repeat yourself,

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
3 Describe a possible situation in which the two premises of the first argument are true---it really is raining hard, and there is no other protection from the rain---but the conclusion is false.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=3}
There are many such situations! Maybe you like getting wet. Or maybe you don't like getting wet, but you have some other overriding reason not to take an umbrella: you want to test your new raincoat; you have to carry something with both hands; a serial killer has been targeting umbrella carriers in your neighborhood.
:::

Here is an argument that is really good in one way, but really bad in another:

:::standardform
-   COVID-19 vaccinations are being used by Bill Gates to implant trackable microchips, and offer no genuine medical benefits.
-   If a vaccination offers no genuine medical benefits, you should not get it.
-   You should not get the COVID-19 vaccination.
:::

The *logic* of this argument is quite good: if the premises *were* true, they *would* give you a good reason not to get vaccinated. But the first premise is wildly untrue---an ridiculous conspiracy theory that is unhinged from reality.

What about this argument:

:::standardform
-   You are reading this book.
-   This is a logic book, assigned for a logic class.
-   You are a logic student.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
4 Is this a good argument? Does it get the facts right? Is the logic of the argument good?
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="4"}
The argument gets the facts right: the premises are definitely true, and
probably the conclusion is true too. But note that the truth of the premises
does not *guarantee* the truth of the conclusion. You *could* be the Provost,
reading this book not to learn logic but to make sure it no longer contains
material critical of the University adminstration. In that case, the premises
would be true, but the conclusion false. So the logic of the argument is not
as strong as it could be.
:::

## Strength and Validity

I've given you several examples of arguments, and invited you to start
thinking about what makes some arguments better than others.

In logic, we don't worry about whether or not arguments get the facts right.
We are interested in whether or not the conclusion *follows* from the
premises. We are not interested in whether or not the premises are actually
true.

This relationship---following---comes in degrees. In some cases, the premises,
if they were true, would *guarantee* the truth of the conclusion. That's the
gold standard: the highest degree of following. In other cases, the premises,
if true, would *make probable* the conclusion, but not guarantee it. That's a
lower degree of following.

We call this degree of following the *strength* of the argument. [An argument
is [strong]{.vocab} if and only if, if the premises were true, they would
increase the probability that the conclusin is true.]{.def} Strength comes in
degrees: stronger arguments increase the probablity more, weaker arguments
less.

We call the highest degree of strength *validity*. An argument is
[valid]{.vocab} if and only if it is *impossible* for its premises to be true
but its conclusion false.

In this class, we focus on developing tools for understanding validity, and
put aside arguments of lesser strength. So, once again, here is our official
definition:

Validity
:   [An argument is [valid]{.vocab} if and only if it is impossible for all
    the premises to be true but the conclusion false.]{.def}

A valid argument can have false premises. The definition doesn't say that the
premises *are* all true and the conclusion false. It makes a claim about what
is possible---or, rather, what isn't possible.

Here is an example of a valid argument with a false premise:

::: standardform
1.  Oranges are either fruits or musical instruments.
2.  Oranges are not fruits.
3.  Oranges are musical instruments.
:::

This is a valid argument. The second premise is not true. But if both premises
*were* true, that would be enough to *absolutely guarantee* the truth of the
conclusion. In other words, it is *impossible* for the premises to be true but
the conclusion false.

Do you see how the definition works? Students often struggle with this, and
search for easier to understand glosses. But these glosses are dangerous. The
definition is carefully crafted: each part is there for good reason.

One unofficial gloss that is fairly safe is in terms of *absolute guarantees*:
the premises, if they were true, would *absolutely guarantee* the truth of the
conclusion. Notice that 'were' and 'would'. I did not say that premises *are*
true, or that they *do* guarantee the truth of the conclusion. I just said
that if they *were* true they *would* guarantee the truth of the conclusion.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
5 Suppose I claim that you are *absolutely guaranteed* to lose weight if you follow my new fad diet plan. Can you restate my claim as a claim about impossibility, in the style of our official definition of validity?
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=5}
I am claiming that it is *impossible* for you to follow my diet but not lose weight.
:::

The example of the argument that oranges are musical instruments demonstrates that a valid argument can have a false premise and a false conclusion. It is also important to understand that an argument can have true premises and a true conclusion, yet not be valid. Here is an example:

:::standardform
-   You are reading this book.
-   This is a logic book, assigned for a logic class.
-   You are a logic student.
:::

Presumably, the premises of this argument are in fact true, and the
conclusion is as well. But as we saw before, the argument is not valid: the
truth of the premises doesn't *absolutely guarantee* the truth of the
conclusion. It is *possible* that the premises both be true, but the
conclusion false, as would be the case if you were not a student but a nosy
Provost.

Sometimes we use words like 'possible' and 'impossible' in loose ways. Someone
who is very tired might claim that it is just impossible for her to get out of
bed. Someone who already has other plans might say that it is impossible for
him go out for drinks with you tonight. But these things aren't really
impossible: she *could* get out bed; he *could* abandon his other plans.

In our definition of validity, we are using 'impossible' in the strictest
possible way. When we say that for an argument to be valid it has to be
*impossible* that the premises are true but the conclusion false, we don't
just mean that it has to be *really difficult* fo this to be so, or *highly
unlikely* that this be so. We meant that it has to be *absolutely* and
*completely* impossible. Think of the kind of impossibility involved in
imagining a triangle with four sides, or a collection of three things that is
greater in number than a collection of two things.

Even falsehoods that are really obviously false, and for which it's hard to
imagine how they could be true, might be *possible* in our strictest sense.
For example, it's not *absolutely impossible* that pigs fly. Someone might
invent powerful wings for them. Or a wizard might give them magical flying
powers. These aren't the sorts of things that *will* happen, but they *could*
happen.


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}

| *this argument is valid
| this argument is invalid
```

::: {.reaction .incorrect ex="6"}
Imagine a possible situation in which all men *are* carrots. That is
far-fetched, but it is not absolutely impossible. And imagine that, in this
situation, Socrates is still a man. In this situation, the conclusion must be
true, and cannot be false: Socrates must be a carrot. If you try instead to
imagine that he is not, you either have to assume that he is not a man,
contrary to the second premise, or that not all men are carrots, contrary to
the first premise.
:::


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}

| this argument is valid
| *this argument is invalid
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=7}
Imagine a possible situation in which some men *are* carrots. That is
far-fetched, but it is not absolutely impossible. Note that, unlike last time, you don't have to imagine that *all* men are carrots. Imagine also that, in this
situation, Socrates is still a man. It is consistent with this that he *not*
be a carrot, and so the conclusion be false.
:::


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
8 <div class="standardform"> <ol type="1"> <li>Abe Lincoln was either born in Illinois or he was once president.</li> <li>Abe Lincoln was never president.</li> <li>Abe Lincoln was born in Illinois.</li> </ol> </div>
| *This argument is valid
| This argument is invalid
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=8}
The first premise tells us that there are two
options for Abe: either he was born in Illinois, or he was never President.
The second premise tells us that he was never President. This is actually
false, but that is not our concern here. We want to know whether or not the
premises, if they *were* true, would *absolutely guarantee* the truth of the
conclusion. So imagine that this second premise is true. Can the conclusion be
false? No: if those are the two options for Abe, and he doesn't satisfy the
second option, then he must satisfy the first, by being born in Illinois.
:::


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}

| *This argument is valid
| This argument is invalid
```

## Valid and Sound

In logic, we don't worry about whether or not arguments get the facts right.
We are interested in whether or not arguments are *valid*, and as we've seen,
an argument can have false premises.

But when it comes time to apply logic beyond the confines of the classroom, we
often do care about whether or not arguments get the facts right. And so we
worry not just about whether or not arguments are *valid*, but also about
whether or not they are *sound*:

Soundness
:   [An argument is [sound]{.vocab} if and only if (a) it is valid and (b) all of its premises are true.]{.def}

Consider, for example, arguments for the existence of God. It is easy to come
up with *valid* argument for the existence of God. Here is one:

:::standardform
-    The sun is God.
-    The sun exists.
-    God exists
:::

This argument is valid, but is it sound? Only if that first premise is true,
and God really is the sun, which, given what we know about the sun, seems
unlikely.

Here is another valid argument for the existence of God:

:::standardform
-    The universe is the designed.
-    Designed things must have designers, and those designers must exist.
-    The only possible designer of the universe is God.
-    God exists.
:::

We can all agree that this argument is valid: *if* the premises *were* true,
then conclusion would have to be true too. But is sound? That depends on
whether or not the premises are *actually* true. Is it true that the universe
is designed, that designed things must have designers, and that the only
possible designer of our univers is God? There are reasons to doubt all three
of these premises, and so reasons to doubt that this argument is sound.

## A Logic Puzzle

Before going further, I want to introduce you to a famous logic puzzle, by
having you watch a short clip from a movie.

In the following clip from the movie [Labyrinth
(1986)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/){.source target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"}, Sarah comes upon two doors, guarded by four
guards. She is given several pieces of information, and she then reasons from
those pieces of information---her premises---to a conclusion about which door
leads to the castle. As you watch, pay attention to the information she is
given, the conclusion she draws, and the reasoning she uses to reach that
conclusion. And ask yourself: Does she reason well? Is her argument valid? Does her conclusion follow
from her premises? Or does she make a mistake?

:::illustration
![Sarah's Puzzle](https://dsanson.github.io/logic-materials/vid/labyrinth-clip.mp4)
:::

Sarah talks fast! Don't worry if you didn't track her reasoning the first time
through. In answering the following questions, you will probably want to
replay the key part of the video.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
10   What is the conclusion Sarah reasons to?
11   What are the premises she reasons from?
12   Is her reasoning valid? Or did she make a mistake? 
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="12"}
Sarah's argument is complicated. If you struggled to unpack it, and answer
those questions with confidence, that's more than OK. Come back and think
about it more later. As we continue to consider arguments, often using
relatively simple examples, it can be helpful to have more complicated
examples, like Sarah's argument, in the back of your mind.
:::


## Identifying Premises and Conclusions

So far, I have been giving you arguments in [standard form]{.vocab}. That's
what we call it when we list the premises, followed by the conclusion, and
mark the conclusion with '∴'.

But when you encounter arguments in the wild, they are rarely in standard form.
Suppose I say,

:::example
-   **Since** you are allergic to cats, you should not get a cat.
:::

This is an argument. I am offering you a *reason* against getting a cat, and that reason is that you are allergic to cats.
That's part of what the word 'since' means: it marks 'you are allergic to
cats' as a *premise*, and so implicitly tells us that the other clause must the be the conclusion. 

So here is this argument in standard form:

:::standardform
-   You are allergic to cats.
-   You should not get a cat.
:::

There are several words and phrases in English that are used to mark premises, like 'since'. Here is a list of some of them:

[[Premise Markers]{.vocab}: since, because, for, given that, in light of, seeing as, ...]{.def}

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
13  You should not become an elementary school teacher, seeing as you don't like little kids.
| 'You should not become an elementary school teacher' is a premise.
| *'You should not become an elementary school teacher' is the conclusion.
| *'You don't like little kids' is a premise.
| 'You don't like little kids' is the conclusion.
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
14  Rewrite the argument in standard form.
```

We also have words in English that are used to mark conclusions. Consider
the use 'so' in this example:

:::example
-   You don't know any of those people, but they seem like people you would
    like, **so** you should go to the party.
:::

Here, the conclusion is 'You should go to the party'. That's what the word
'so' indicates. Again, English has several words and phrases that can be used
in this way. Here is a list of some of them:

[[Conclusion Markers]{.vocab}:   therefore, hence, thus, so, 'and so it follows that', ...]{.def}

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10} 
15 Everyone who says they are a donkey says they are an animal. Everyone who says they are an animal speaks the truth. Therefore everyone who says they are a donkey speaks the truth.
| *'Everyone who says they are a donkey says they are an animal' is a premise.
| 'Everyone who says they are a donkey says they are an animal' is the conclusion.
| *'Everyone who says they are an animal speaks the truth' is a premise.
| 'Everyone who says they are an animal speaks the truth' is the conclusion.
| 'Everyone who says they are a donkey speaks the truth' is a premise.
| *'Everyone who says they are a donkey speaks the truth' is the conclusion.
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
16  Rewrite the argument in standard form.
```

English is lazy. We don't mark *each* part of an argument. We mark one or two parts, and leave it to the reader to figure out the rest.

English is also flexible. The *order* in which different claims are
made is no guide, by itself, to which claims are the premises and which is the
conclusion. The conclusion can come first, followed by the premises. Or the
premises can come first, followed by the conclusion. Or the conclusion can
come in the middle, surrounded by premises. 

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10} 
17 You should trust scientists, so you should believe in global warming, since scientists tell us that global warming is real.
| *'You should trust scientists' is a premise.
| 'You should trust scientists' is the conclusion.
| 'You should believe in global warming' is a premise.
| *'You should believe in global warming' is the conclusion.
| *'Scientists tell us that global warming is real' is a premise.
| 'Scientists tell us that global warming is real' is the conclusion.
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
18  Rewrite the argument in standard form.
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
19  "Other animals eat meat, so it is okay for humans to eat meat."
| 'so' is a premise marker.
| *'so' is a conclusion marker.
| The conclusion of this argument is "other animals eat meat".
| *The conclusion of this argument is "it is okay for humans to eat meat".
| *A premise of this argument is "other animals eat meat".
| A premise of this argument is "it is okay for humans to eat meat".
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
20 Rewrite the argument in standard form. 
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=20}
::: standardform
-   Other animals eat meat.
-   It is okay for humans to eat meat.
:::
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
21 "Morality is objective, and therefore God exists, for, after all, without God, there would be no objective right and wrong."
| *'therefore' is a conclusion indicator
| 'therefore' is a premise indicator
| 'for' is a conclusion indicator 
| *'for' is a premise indicator 
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
22  In this argument,
| *the conclusion is 'God exists'. 
| the conclusion is 'God exists, for, after all, without God, there would be no objective right and wrong'. 
| *'Without God there would be no objective right and wrong' is a premise.
| 'God exists' is a premise
| *'Morality is objective' is a premise
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
23 Rewrite the argument in standard form.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=23}  
The word 'therefore' marks 'God exists' as the conclusion, and the phrase 'for,
after all' marks 'Without God, there would be no objective right or wrong' as
a premise. That leaves 'Morality is objective' unmarked: it is another
premise:

::: standardform
-   Morality is objective.
-   Without God, morality would not be objective.
-   God exists.
:::
:::

## Sentences and Propositions

An argument is a list of sentences: the premises, followed by the conclusion.
But not just any sentences will do.
For example, this is not an argument:

:::standardform
-   Are you allergic to cats?
-   Get a dog!
:::

The sentences that make up an argument must be the kind of sentences that
express *propositions*---the kind of sentences that make claims of the sort
that we can reason from and to. Sentences that express questions are not
sentences of this sort. Neither are sentences that express commands.








```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
24 <p>Sometimes the premise or conclusion of an argument will be phrased as a question, but is really meant to express a proposition. Can you put this argument into standard form, rephrasing the conclusion as a sentence that expresses a proposition, rather than a question?</p> <div class="example"> <ul> <li>How can anyone think that it is okay to eat meat? Meat comes from animals, and animals are living creatures with feelings, just like us.</li> </ul> </div>
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=24}  
Your answer should look something like this:

:::standardform
-   Meat comes from animals.
-   Animals are living creatures with feelings.
-   It is not okay to eat meat.
:::
:::

## Thinking about the Definitions of Validity and Soundness

Recall our two defintions:

Validity
:   An argument is [valid]{.vocab} if and only if it is impossible for the
    premises to be true while the conclusion is false.

Soundness
:   An argument is [sound]{.vocab} if and only if it is valid and all of its
    premises are actually true.

Here are some questions meant to help you think more about what these
definitions mean.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
25 Suppose an argument has a false premise. This means that:
| it is not valid.
| *it is not sound.
| none of the above.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=25}
For an argument to be *sound*, all of its premises must be true. So, if the
argument has a false premise, we know that it is not sound.

Lots of valid arguments have false premises. For example:

:::standardform
-   Normal is either in Illinois or Indiana.
-   Normal is not in Illinois.
-   Normal is in Indiana.
:::

This argument is valid, even though the second premise is false. That's
because, if the premises *were* true, the conclusion *would have to be* true
too.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
26 Suppose an argument has a true conclusion. This means that:
| it is not valid.
| it is not sound.
| *none of the above.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=26}
An argument can have a true conclusion, even though it is neither valid nor
sound. Here is trivial an example:

:::standardform
-   Snow is white.
-   Grass is green.
-   Birds are not mammals.
:::

The conclusion of this argument is true. But the argument is not valid, and it
is not sound.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
27 Suppose an argument has true premises and a true conclusion. This means that:
| it is not valid.
| it is not sound.
| *none of the above.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=27}
We cannot determine whether or not an argument is valid just by noting that is premises are actaully true and its conclusion is actually true. Consider:

:::standardform
-   Roses are red.
-   Violets are blue.
-   Onions stink.
-   You stink too.
:::

The premises are true and (let's suppose) the conclusion is true too. But the conclusion doesn't follow from the premises, and the argument is not valid.

## Recognizing Validity and Soundness

It can be difficult to recognize whether or not an argument is valid, and
whether or not it is sound. It requires some mental gymnastics. First, to
assess validity, you have to spend some time thinking about what is
*possible*: is there some possible way that those premises could be true,
without the conclusion also being true? But then, to assess soundness, you
need to yank yourself back to cold hard reality: are those premises *actually
factually* true?

<!-- ::: standardform -->
<!-- -  Normal is a city in Illinois. -->
<!-- -  Chicago is a city in Illinois. -->
<!-- -  Illinois is in the Midwest. -->
<!-- ::: -->

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
28 <div class="standardform"> <ul> <li>Normal is a city in Illinois.</li> <li>Chicago is a city in Illinois.</li> <li>Illinois is in the Midwest.</li> </ul> </div>
| *All of the premises of this argument are actually true.
| *The conclusion of this argument is actually true.
| This argument is valid.
| This argument is sound.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=28}
This argument has true premises and a true conclusion, but the
conclusion does not follow from the premises. More specifically, in terms
of our definition of validity, the premises could both be true, but the
conclusion false. 

To see this, imagine a possibility in which the premises are
true but the conclusion false. For example, imagine that US westward expansion ended in the early 19th
century, making the western border of Illinois the western border of the US.
So the conclusion is false. But suppose that, in this possible situation,
Chicago and Normal develop more or less the same way they actually did. So
both the premises are true.

Since the argument is not valid, it is not sound: to be sound, an argument
must both be valid AND have all true premises.

<!-- -   Normal and Chicago are both cities in the same state -->

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
29 <div class="standardform"> <ul> <li>Normal is a city in Indiana</li> <li>Chicago is a city in Indiana</li> <li>Indiana is a state</li> <li>Normal and Chicago are both cities in the same state</li> </ul> </div>
| All of the premises of this argument are actually true.
| *The conclusion of this argument is actually true.
| *This argument is valid.
| This argument is sound.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=29}
This argument has a true conclusion, but its first two premises are false. But that
doesn't tell us whether or not it is valid. To figure that out, we need to
think about whether the conclusion *follows* from the premises, in the sense
defined by our definition of validity: is it *possible* for the premises to
all be true, but the conclusion false?

No, this is not possible: any possibility that makes it true that Normal and
Chicago are both cities in Indiana, and holds true the fact that Indiana is a
state, is also going to make it true that Normal and Chicago are cities in the
same state. So the argument is valid, because it is impossible for the
premises to all be true, but the conclusion false.

The argument is not sound, because it has false premises. In order for an
argument to be sound, it must both be valid AND have all true premises.

This argument is valid, and the premises are all true. So it is also sound.

```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=31}
This argument is also valid. Notice that it has the same logical form as the
previous argument, about Biden. Arguments with this logical form are valid in
virtue of their form---that is, they are formally valid. But in this case, the
first premise is false. So the argument is not sound.

| This argument is valid.
| This argument is sound.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=32}
This argument is not valid. Compare its form to the form of the previous two
arguments. Those arguments had this logical form:

::: standardform
| [$P$]{.premise .nn}
| [If $P$, $Q$]{.premise .nn}
| [$Q$]{.conclusion}
:::

This argument has a similar, but importantly different, logical form:

::: standardform
| [$P$]{.premise .nn}
| [If $Q$, $P$]{.premise .nn}
| [$Q$]{.conclusion}
:::

Arguments with first form are formally valid. Arguments with this second form
are not formally valid.

Do you see why the argument is not valid? Imagine that some other Democrat had
won the primary, and then won the election. Then the premises would both still
be true, but the conclusion would be false.

| All of the premises of this argument are actually true.
| *The conclusion of this argument is actually true.
| *This argument is valid.
| This argument is sound.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=33}
This is a degenerate case of validity. To see that it is valid, think hard
about the definition of validity. Is there a possible situation in which the
premises are all true while the conclusion is false?
