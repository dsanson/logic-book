## Introduction

This unit introduces our topic, logic, 
 and introduces several key concepts that will play a central role in our
 study of logic.

The learning objectives for this unit are:

-   You have a basic understanding of what [logic]{.vocab} is.
-   You can apply the concepts of an [argument]{.vocab}, a [premise]{.vocab}, and a
    [conclusion]{.vocab} to short argumentative passages in English.
-   You can apply the concepts of [validity]{.vocab}, [soundness]{.vocab}, and [inductive
    strength]{.vocab} to simple arguments in standard form.

## What follows? 

This entire course is built around one key idea:
sometimes, certain information *follows* from other information.

This is perhaps most familiar from dreaded "word problems" in mathematics.
If I tell you that the legs of a right triangle are 3 inches and 4 inches, it
*follows*, by the Pythagorean Theorem, that the hypotenuse is 5 inches:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a^2 + b^2 &= c^2 \\
3^2 + 4^2 &= c^2 \\
9 + 16 &= c^2 \\
25 &= c^2 \\
c &= 5 
\end{aligned}
$$

Or if I give you some information about the bus schedule, the current time,
your distance from the bus stop, and your top running speed, it might *follow*
from that information that, even running at your top running speed, you will
not be able to catch the bus, assuming it is on time.

But *following* isn't limited to math problems. There are two courses that you
want to take, but they meet at the same time: it *follows* that you cannot
sign up for both. Your roommate is visiting her parents in Chicago, and nobody
can be in two places at the same time: it *follows* that the person in your
apartment is not your roommate.

Sometimes, some given information might *suggest* a conclusion, even though
that conclusion doesn't *follow* from that information.

Suppose I know that you like pizza. Does it *follow* that you want to eat
pizza tonight? No. At best, it *suggests* that you *might* want to eat pizza
tonight; but you might want to eat something else instead.

Suppose you know that I work at ISU. Does it *follow* that I live in Normal?
No. At best, it *makes it more likely* that I live in Normal. But I might live somewhere further away and commute.

Suppose your car is reliable. Does it *follow* that it won't break down? No.
Even reliable cars break down sometimes. A reliable car is *unlikely* to break
down, but there is no *guarantee*: the conclusion that it won't break down
doesn't *follow* from the fact that it is reliable.

Suppose I've invited most of my closest friends to my wedding, but I didn't
invite you. Does it *follow* that you aren't one of my closest friends? No. It
*suggests* that I might not think of you as a close friend, but (a) I might be
wrong about that or (b) maybe I didn't invite you because I knew you had a
conflict, or because I believe you don't like weddings.

We are all familiar with the frustration caused by badly written word problems
in mathematics that *don't give you enough information*. Think about what that
means. It means that, from the information given, no answer *follows*, making
it impossible to find a solution.

Sometimes, people think that something follows when it doesn't. Some folks
seem to think that, if Black lives mattered, it would *follow* that other
lives don't matter, or matter less. But that is a mistake: more than one thing
can matter.

Some folks seem to think that, if some vaccinated folks die from COVID-19,
then if *follows* that the COVID-19 vaccines don't work. But that is also a
mistake. A vaccine is effective if it makes it *much less likely* that you
will die from COVID-19.

Many folks think that, if they've had a run of back luck, it somehow
*follows* (by the "law of averages") that their future odds are improved.
But that is a mistake. Suppose you've flipped heads twenty-five times in a row. The
chance that your next flip will come up tails remain the same: 50%.

What exactly is this *following* relation? It is not a *temporal* relation
between events, as in:

:::displayed
-   Night *follows* day.
:::

This means that night *comes after* day, in time. But when we say that a
conclusion *follows* from given information, we do not mean that it comes
after that information in time.

And it is not about *making sense*, as in:

:::displayed
-   The reader *follows* the plot.
:::

This means that the plot makes sense to the reader. But a line of reasoning
can *make sense* even though the conclusion doesn't follow. For example, if I
know you like pizza, and conclude that you want to order pizza tonight, that
*makes sense*, even though my conclusion doesn't follow.

So, we introduce a technical term for the kind of *following* that we are
interested in: *validity*. We will define validity in a moment. But first, one
more example.

### Sarah's Puzzle

Here is one more example, meant to help you think about the *following*
relation. It is a clip from the movie [Labyrinth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"}. <!--_-->
In the clip, Sarah (played by Jennifer Connelly) is given some information,
and she reasons from that information to a conclusion that she thinks follows.
She talks quickly, so her reasoning goes by very fast. 
See if you can catch it.
Do you think she reasons correctly, and her conclusion really does *follow*
from the information she has been given?
Or do you think she makes a mistake?

:::spoiler
In the clip, the guards give Sarah two pieces of information:

:::display
-   One of the doors leads to the castle, and the other leads to certain death.
-   One of the guards always tells the truth and the other always lies.
:::

She then asks the guard on her left a question, and from his answer, learns one additional
piece of information:

:::display
-   The guard on her left says that the guard on her right would say that the left door leads to the castle.
:::

These are the three pieces of information she reasons from.

Her conclusion is the piece of information she reasons to:

:::display
-   The door on her right leads to the castle.
:::

Acting on that conclusion, she walks confidently through the door on her
right, only to fall screaming into a pit. Did she make a mistake in her
reasoning?
:::

## Arguments, Premises, and Conclusions

Sarah reasons from three *pieces of information* to a new *piece of
information*. [We call each piece of information a [proposition]{.vocab}, and
we express each proposition as a [declarative sentence]{.vocab}---that is, the kind of
sentence that can be true or false.]{.def}

Here are three propositions she reasons *from*:

-   One of the doors leads to the castle, and the other leads to certain death.
-   One of the guards always tells the truth and the other always lies.
-   The guard on her left says that the guard on her right would say that the left door leads to the castle.

The proposition she reasons *to* is this:

-   The door on her right leads to the castle.

[We call the information she reasons *from* her [premises]{.vocab}. And we call
the information she reasons *to* her [conclusion]{.vocab}. We call the whole
thing taken together an [argument]{.vocab}.]{.def}

::: {.illustration style="float:right"}

:::

Here is another example. Suppose I tell you that,

-   This jar contains both chocolate chip cookies and sugar cookies,
-   If you select any two cookies at random from this jar, at least one of them
    will be a sugar cookie.

Given these two premises, you should be able to figure out how many chocolate chip cookies are in the jar.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
3 How many chocolate chip cookies are in the jar?
| *At least one
| *At most one
| *Exactly one
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=3 ans=0}
You are right that there is at least one chocolate chip cookie in the jar,
since we know the jar contains both chocolate chip cookies and sugar cookies,
so it has to have at least one chocolate chip cookie.

But think more about what the second piece of information tells you.
:::

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=3 ans=1}
You are right that there is at most one chocolate chip cookie in the jar.
Otherwise, when picking two at random, you could end up with two chocolate
chip cookies and no sugar cookie.

But, based on the information you were given, 
could there be *no* chocolate chip cookies in the jar?
:::

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=3 ans="01 02 12"}
Think about how 'at least', 'at most' and 'exactly' are related.
:::

:::{.reaction .correct ex=3}
That's right! At least one, and at most one, so exactly one!
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
4 Try to explain, as clearly as possible, how this conclusion follows from the two premises.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=2}
If you aren't comfortable with the answer you just gave, that's okay! 
We are just getting started.
This isn't a test;
 it's just a mental exercise, 
 meant to help you start to think about *what reasoning is* and *how it works*.
:::

We can represent arguments visually, using a kind of flow chart known as an argument map:

<!--

  node [shape = box, fontname = "Georgia", fontsize = "10pt"];

:::

In this argument map, the premises are in the top box, and the conclusion is
the box below.
The arrow represents the *following* relation---the idea that this conclusion
follows from those premises.
The map does not represent the *reasoning* that we might use to get from the
premises to the conclusion. We will learn how to represent that later.

So this is the general structure of an argument map:

Drawing argument maps every time you want to represent an argument is
inconvenient. Instead, we will usually represent arguments by writing them in
*standard form*. [[Standard Form]{.vocab}: a way of representing an argument,
by listing each premise, followed by the conclusion. We mark the conclusion
with the '∴' ("therefore") symbol.]{.def}

Here is the cookie jar argument, written in standard form:

::: standardform
-   This jar contains both chocolate chip cookies and sugar cookies.
-   If you take any two cookies at random from the jar, at least one of them
    will be a sugar cookie.
-   There is one chocolate chip cookie in the jar.
:::

Sometimes, it is convenient to number the premises:

::: standardform
1.   This jar contains both chocolate chip cookies and sugar cookies.
2.   If you take any two cookies at random from the jar, at least one of them
    will be a sugar cookie.
3.   There is one chocolate chip cookie in the jar.

Suppose you see some dude wearing a Che Guevara
t-shirt, and infer that he is a communist. That's a good example of a
conclusion that might be *suggested* by the premise, but doesn't *follow* from
the premise.

Does that match what you wrote down? If not, what were you confused about?
:::

Again, this is a good example of a conclusion that is *suggested* by, but does
not *follow* from the premise.

## Identifying Premises and Conclusions

When folks give arguments, they don't usually give you an argument map, or
present their argument in standard form. For example, here is an argument:

:::example
You shouldn't major in philosophy, since philosophy is a useless major.
:::

In order to rewrite this argument in standard form, you need to identify its
premise(s) and conclusion. Remember, the
premise(s) are meant to provide a *reason* in support of the
conclusion. So which part of this argument expresses the *reason*, and which
part is meant to be supported by that reason?

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
5. Can you rewrite this argument in standard form?
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=5}
Your answer should look like this:

::: standardform
-   Philosophy is a useless major.
-   You shouldn't major in philosophy.
:::
:::

Later we will consider whether or not this a *good* argument. 
(Spoiler alert! I don't think it is!)
But for now I want to focus on a different question:
what clue or clues are there in the argument, as originally stated, that allow
us to determine which part is the premise and which part is the conclusion?

In this case, the key clue is the word 'since'.
'Since' is here used as a [[premise indicator]{.vocab}: 
a word or phrase that marks what follows as a premise or reason in support.
Common premise indicators include 'since', 'because', and 'for'.]{.def}

In this case, what follows the word 'since' is the sentence, 'philosophy is a
useless major', so 'since' marks that sentence as a premise:

:::example
You shouldn't major in philosophy, **since** [philosophy is a useless
major]{.wavy}
:::

Here is another example:

::: example
Since you can't always get what you want, you should be happy with what you get.
:::

`````{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
6.  Which of the following is marked as a premise by the word 'since':
| *You can't always get what you want.
| *You can't always get what you want, you should be happy with what you get.
| You should be happy with what you get.
`````

:::{.reaction .correct ex=6}

The word 'since' marks the *complete sentence* that comes after it as a
premise. So:

::: example
**Since** [you can't always get what you want]{.wavy}, you should be happy with what you get.
:::
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
7.  Rewrite the argument in standard form.
```

:::{.reaction correct ex=7}
::: standardform
-   You can't always get what you want.
-   You should be happy with what you get.
:::
:::

Notice that in English, we can express the premise first, followed by the
conclusion, or we can express the conclusion first, followed by the premise.
The *order of expression*, in English, does not always match the *logical
order*, as represented in standard form. These two sentences express the same
argument:

:::example
-   **Since** [you can't always get what you want]{.wavy}, you should be happy with what you get.
-   You should be happy with what you get, **since** [you can't always get what you want]{.wavy}, 
:::

Another premise indicator in English is is 'because':

:::example
We need to address carbon emissions, because if we don't, the effects of
global warming will only get worse.
:::

Again, don't take my word for it.
Stop for a moment, and think about what this sentence means,
 and the role of the word 'because'.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
5 Rewrite the argument in standard form.
```
:::{.reaction .correct ex=5}
::: standardform
-   If we don't address carbon emissions, the effects of global warming will
    only get worse.
-   We need to address carbon emissions.
:::
:::

Note that 'since' and 'because' don't *always* mark premises. When the Beatles
sing, 'Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry', they are not saying that the
color of the sky is a premise, in support of the conclusion that they are in
tears. And when Kelly Clarkson says, 'Since you've been gone, I can breathe
for the first time,' she is not offering an argument in support of the
conclusion that she can breathe.

We also have words in English that are used to mark conclusions. [A 
[conclusion marker]{.vocab} is a word or phrase that marks what follows as a
conclusion. Common conclusion markers include 'therefore', 'so', and
'hence'.]{.def}
:::

For example,

:::example
Other animals eat meat, so it is okay for humans to eat meat.
:::

So you see what 'so' is doing here?

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
6 Rewrite the argument in standard form.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=6}
::: standardform
-   Other animals eat meat.
-   It is okay for humans to eat meat.
:::
:::

When an argument has more than one premise, 
 things can get more complicated. 
For example,

:::example
Morality is objective, so God exists, since, after all, without God, there
  would be no objective right or wrong.
:::

Can you unpack the structure of this argument? Hint: it has two premises, but
only one of them is marked with a premise marker.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
7 Rewrite the argument in standard form.
```
:::{.reaction .correct ex=7}  
The word 'so' marks 'God exists' as the conclusion, and the phrase 'since,
after all'
marks 'Without God, there would be no objective right or wrong' as a premise:

:::example
Morality is objective, **so** [God exists]{.wavy}, **since, after all**,
  [without God, there would be no objective right or wrong]{.wavy}.
:::

What about 'Morality is objective'? It is another premise, even though no
special word marks it. That's something you, as a reader, just have to
figure out from context. So:

::: standardform
-   Morality is objective.
-   Without God, morality would not be objective.
-   God exists.
:::
:::

## Implicit Premises

Often, when folks give arguments, they don't actually give
*complete* arguments. Consider again the example,

::: example
You shouldn't major in philosophy because philosophy is a useless major.
:::

We represented this as:

::: standardform
1.   Philosophy is a useless major.
2.   You shouldn't major in philosophy.
:::

But a better representation of their argument would make explicit the
assumption that they've left unstated: that *you should major in something
useful*.

::: standardform
1.   Philosophy is a useless major.
2.   You should major in something useful.
3.   You shouldn't major in philosophy.
:::

[An [implicit premise]{.vocab} is an unstated assumption that is required to make
sense of the idea that the explicitly stated premises support the
conclusion.]{.def} When reconstructing arguments, you should always make a
good faith effort to include any implicit premises.

Is this a good argument? Perhaps surprisingly, premise (1) is actually false.
Philosophy majors [do as well as most
other majors on the job market](http://53eig.ht/1NKNeQ9){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"}. <!--_-->
The skills developed by studying philosophy are valuable in a wide range of careers.
I happen to think that premise (2) is also actually false, and that ["being
useful" is not the only value in play when choosing a major](https://www.academia.edu/2454947/Liberal_Arts_and_the_Advantages_of_Being_Useless){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"}. <!--_--> But I do think the argument is good in
this sense: the conclusion *follows* from the premises; if they were both
true, the conclusion would have to be true too.

Sometimes, when we make an implicit premise explicit, the implicit premise is
so *obviously* false that the argument collapses of its own weight. Consider
again,

:::standardform
-  Other animals eat meat.
-  It is okay for humans to eat meat.
:::

What's the implicit premise here? Is it true?

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
8 Rewrite the argument in standard form, but this time include the implicit premise.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=8}
There is no one correct answer to this question. 
But maybe you came up with something like this:

::: standardform
1.  Other animals eat meat.
2.  It is okay for humans to do something if other animals do it.
3.  It is okay for humans to eat meat.
:::

Do you see that (2) is premise (2) is obviously false?
Cats torture mice,
dogs hump in the park and poop on the street. 
[Male sea otters kidnap pups
 and hold them underwater,
 to force mother sea otters to give them food.](https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/animals-can-be-giant-jerks/){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"} <!--_--> 
These are all things animals do, 
 that it is not okay for humans to do.
(For an example of someone who might have accepted (2), and thought it was fine
for humans to hump in the park or poop on the neighbor's lawn, see [Diogenes
the Cynic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"}, an ancient Greek philosopher who took the idea
that one should "act according to nature" to surprising extremes.) <!--_-->
:::

Sometimes, it can be quite hard to figure out what the relevant implicit
premise is meant to be. That's how I feel, at least, about the argument:

:::example
Given that the universe is very big and you are very small, your life is
meaningless.
:::

Here is the argument as stated in standard form:

::: standardform
1.  The universe is very big.
2.  You are very small.
3.  Your life is meaningless.
:::

Do you see that there is something missing here? Some further claim being
assumed? What is the implicit premise? Or perhaps there is more than one?

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
9 Rewrite the argument in standard form, identifying the implicit premise(s).
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=9}  
Perhaps the argument is meant to go something like this:

::: standardform
1.  The universe is very big.
2.  You are very small.
3.  The lives of small things are meaningless.
4.  Your life is meaningless.
:::

But notice that (3),
 as stated, isn't comparative.
The original argument suggests that,
 by comparing ourselves to the universe,
 we can see that our lives are meaningless.
But on this reconstruction,
 the argument just says that your life is meaningless because you are small,
 not because the universe is big and you are small.

Here is another attempt to render the argument explicitly:

::: standardform
1.  The universe is very big.
2.  You are very small.
3.  A life is meaningful only if it makes a big impact on the universe.
4.  The life of a very small thing cannot have a big impact on a very big
    universe.
5.  Your life is meaningless.
:::

This time, we added two implicit premises.
Premise (3) says something about what it takes for a life to be meaningful.
Premise (4) explains why, being small, your life doesn't have what it takes.

Suppose that's the argument.
Do you agree that the premises are true?
I'm inclined to think that (3) is false,
 in part because I think that even a small impact can be meaningful.
:::


[In any case]{.newthought}, our task here is not to address deep questions
about the meaning of life. This is a logic class. Our task is to understand
arguments, and, more specifically, what makes good arguments good and bad
arguments bad. This is the task we turn to in the next chapter.

## Sarah's Puzzle, Again

Let's return to consider Sarah's puzzle. She is given some information, and
she reasons from that information, to the conclusion that the right door leads
to the castle. What is her given information? That is, what are her premises?

First, the guards volunteer two pieces of information:

1.  One of the doors leads to the castle, and the other leads to certain
    death.
2.  One of the guards always tells the truth, and the other one always lies.

Call someone who always tells the truth a *knight*, and someone who always
tells lies a *knave*. Sarah's puzzle is an example of a [Knights and Knaves
Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"}. There are lots of neat Knights and Knaves puzzles.

And call the guard on Sarah's left "Lefty" and the guard on her right "Righty."

Sarah asks Lefty a question. From his answer, she gleans another piece of
information:

3.  Lefty says that Righty would say that the left door leads to the castle.

These are her three premises. So here is her argument, in standard form:

::: standardform
1.  One of the doors leads to the castle, and the other leads to certain
    death.
2.  One of Righty and Lefty is a knight, and the other is a knave.
3.  Lefty says that Righty would say that the left door leads to the castle.
4.  The right door leads to the castle.
:::

This gives us her argument, but it doesn't represent her *reasoning*: the
steps she took to reason from (1), (2), and (3) to (4). Can you reconstruct
it?

Remember that, by premise (3), Lefty says that Righty would say that the left
door leads to the castle. Sarah's reasons by considering two possibilities:

-   Suppose Lefty is a knave and Righty is a knight. Then what do we know about what Lefty
    says? And so what do we know about what Righty would say?
-   Suppose Lefty is a knight and Righty is a knave. Then what do we know about what Lefty
    says? And so what do we know about about Righty would say?

## Wrapping Up

By now, you should have some sense of what [logic]{.vocab} is—the study of reasoning, and, more
specifically, the study of arguments. You should also know what an
[argument]{.vocab} is: it consists of some [premises]{.vocab} that are meant
to support a [conclusion]{.vocab}. And you should understand that premises and
conclusions are declarative sentences that express [propositions]{.vocab}---that is,
pieces of information, that are either true or false. Finally, you should be able to
identify the premises and conclusion of an argument, making use of [premise
markers]{.vocab} and [conclusion markers]{.vocab}, put the argument in
standard form, and worry about whether or not the argument has any [implicit
premises]{.vocab}, and if so, what they might be.
