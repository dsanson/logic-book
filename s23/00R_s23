I teach two sections of this course. Please attend the appropriate section.

## Short course description

This is a class in formal logic. We cover sentential logic and predicate
logic, with a focus on translation and natural deduction.

## What you are actually getting yourself into

In *logic* we study reasoning, and what makes good reasoning good and bad
reasoning bad. In *formal* logic, we do this by studying *logical form*, and
identifying those forms of reasoning that are good, and those that are bad.
For example, this form of reasoning is good:

> If P is true, then Q is true. P is true. Therefore, Q is true.

But this form of reasoning is bad:

> If P is true, then Q is true. Q is true. Therefore, P is true.

When we reason, we are processing *information*. Maybe you have been told by
your boss that if you are late, then your pay will be docked, and you know
that you will be late. You can reason from those two pieces of information, to
the conclusion that your pay will be docked. Or maybe you know that, if the
moon explodes, the earth's atmosphere will be destroyed, and you know that the
moon will explode, so you reason to the conclusion that the atmosphere will be
destroyed. The *logical form* of the information and the reasoning is the same
in both cases, but the *content* is different.

In the short course description, I said that we will study both sentential
logic and predicate logic. In sentential logic, we concentrate on forms
generated by combining sentences using words like 'if...then...',
'both...and...', and 'either...or...'. In predicate logic, we add additional
forms, generated by combining predicates with proper names and variables, and
binding those variables with quantifiers.

We will use an artificial language to describe and display logical forms. 
Sentences in this langauge look like formulas from algebra. Here are some examples:

::: example
-   P → (Q ∧ R), which means *If P, then both Q and R*
-   ∀x∃y(F(x) ↔ G(y)), which means *For every x, some y is such that x is F if and only if y is G*
:::

In the short course description, I said that will focus on translation and
natural deduction. By "translation", I meant translating sentences in English
into sentences in our artificial language, a process that involves both
understanding our artificial language, and thinking about the logical forms of
English sentences.

Natural deduction is a way of representing and reconstructing complex chains
of reasoning, of the sort you might encounter in a mathematical proof or a
work of philosophy. There are several systems that have been designed for
doing this. The short course description mentions the system we will be using.
But that is probably only meaningful to other logic professors.

This class has one foot in mathematics, and one foot in language. If you think
of yourself as good at math but bad at language, or bad at language but good
at math, you will probably find parts of this class easy, and parts hard. Most
students report that the class makes their brain hurt in one way or another.
Please understand: this is a *good* thing. It means your brain is being
rewired, and you are gaining new powers.

One of the secrets to those new powers: the sharp distinction between math and
language is not as real as you think. For that matter, neither is the sharp
distinction between the sciences and the humanities. The study of logic cuts
across the first, just as the study of philosophy cuts across the second. This
class is meant to rewire your brain, and make you *think* in a new way, that
does not respect such distinctions. This new way of thinking applies to
anything and everything you ever might think about.

## Aside: About this document

This unit the course syllabus, but is is also a tutorial, introducing you to the nuts and bolts of course
assignments.

All units, including this one, include questions that you need to answer or
exercises that you need to complete, as you read. For example, you need to
answer this multiple choice question now. Just for fun, try giving the *wrong* answer, and see what happens.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
1 This unit is
|*a tutorial, but also the syllabus, and also counts for course credit.
|an optional introduction with sample questions that don't actually count for course credit.
```

If you selected the wrong answer, you were told so, and asked to try again.
Questions and exercises in the reading are always like this. The software will
not allow you to submit an incorrect answer. If you try to do so, you will be
asked to try again, until you get it right.

I can make things more difficult on you by giving you a multiple choice
question with multiple correct answers, and asking you to select all the
correct answers:

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
2 The kinds of questions that are asked in this unit include (select all correct answers):
| *multiple choice questions with one correct answer
| *multiple choice questions with several correct answers, like this one
| CAPTCHAs designed to verify that you are human
| *open-ended short response questions
```

I can also include open-ended short response questions, like this:

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
3 Why are you taking this class? What do you hope to get out of it?
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="3"}
Sometimes, when you submit an answer to a question, a reaction box like this
will open, giving you a bit of feedback or advice.
:::

For short response questions like (3), you get full credit for submitting
*something*. I will typically use such questions to encourage you to stop and
think: the value lies in your making the attempt, not in whether or not you
get it right.



## Course design and expectations

This class is *flipped*. I will not lecture. I expect you to read and work
outside of class, and make an effort to figure things out for yourself. In
class, I will help you figure out whatever you couldn't figure out on your
own.

This will likely make you *uncomfortable*. Trying to figure out how to do
logic by reading about it on your own is hard. It *feels better* if someone
first walks you through each step, before you try to figure it out for
yourself. But experience shows that what *feels* better *works* worse. Until
you've tried it for yourself, you aren't really in a position to learn from
somebody else's explanations.

More generally, the best way to learn is to *try*, *fail*, *get help*, and
*try again*. That's uncomfortable, because we don't like failing, and many of
us don't really like asking for help. It is more comfortable to *wait*, and
only *try* once you think you can *avoid failing*. But, again, that is more
comfortable, but in practice it doesn't work very well.

This class is designed to maximize your chances to try, maximize your
chances to fail, maximize your chances to get help, and maximize your chances
to try again.

But---and I can't emphasize this enough---**you need to take advantage of these
chances for yourself**. You need to try early and often. You need to give yourself permission
to fail and try again. You need to ask for help when there is something you
aren't getting. And you need to take advantage of the opportunities to try
again, and again, and again, as needed, until you really learn the material.

**Trying early and often** means reading and trying *before* class, not during
class. Ideally, you come to class knowing that you are confused and knowing
what you are confused about.

**Giving yourself permission to fail** means not just being willing to make
mistakes, but being willing to learn from those mistakes. Each unit is
followed by a *mastery check*. This is a mini test, but if you fail it, that's
okay: you can retake it several times. What is important is that you figure
out how to *learn* from that failure. What went wrong, and why? What was it
that you didn't understand? What can you do to understand that better, and
avoid similar mistakes on future retakes? Some students try to bulldoze their
way to success, taking retake after retake, in hopes that they will pass by
brute force or luck. This usually doesn't work.

**Asking for help** means reaching out to me or to your classmates. Don't
suffer in silence. Nobody expects you to learn logic on your own. We are in
this together, and, most importantly, I am here to help. That might involve
spending some one-on-one time in class or office hours, working through some
problems. It might involve an impromptu mini-lecture, going over some key
concept or process that you are stuck on. All kinds of help is available. But
only you can tell me where you're stuck, so we can work on figuring out how to
get you unstuck.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
4 For this course, you are expected
| *to do the reading before class, and come to class confused
| to wait and only attempt problems and exercises after the material has been covered in class
| *to pay attention when things go wrong or you make mistakes, and figure out what you didn't understand
| to brute-force your way through exercises and retakes, grinding your way to course credits.
```

## Grades

When it comes to your grade, what matters is how much and how well you learn
in the end. That is, your grade will be determined by *how many* units you *complete or
master* by the end of the term, in accordance with the following chart:


   Course Grade                        Units Complete
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        A         at least 16 units complete, at least 10 of which are complete and mastered
        B         at least 13 [14]{.xed} units completed, at least 8 of which are complete and mastered
        C         at least 10 [12]{.xed} units complete
        D         at least 7 [8]{.xed} units complete

A unit can either be incomplete, complete, or complete and mastered:

Complete and Mastered
:    Reading = 100% and Mastery check ≥ 80%

Complete
:    Reading = 100% and Mastery check ≥ 60%

Incomplete
:    Reading < 100% or Mastery check < 60%

As you can see from the chart, you don't get any credit for incomplete units.

In addition, certain key units are **required** for certain grades, according
to the following chart:

   Course Grade                        Required units
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        A         Must complete units 04,05,09,10
        B         Must complete units 04,05,09
        C         Must complete units 04,05,[09]{.xed}


Predictably, these are the units are the ones that experience shows students are most tempted to avoid.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
5 Select all true claims from the list below:
| *To complete a unit, I need to get 100% on the reading questions and get 60% or above on the mastery check
| *If a unit is mastered and complete, it is also complete
| *It is possible to get a C without mastering any units
| It is possible to get a D without completing any units, as long as I earn a lot of points
| If I complete enough other units, I can pass this class without completing unit 04
| *I can earn a B in this class without mastering unit 04
| I can earn a B in this class without completing unit 04
| *If I complete enough other units, I can pass this class without completing this unit, unit 00
| This course has a final exam
```

## Mastery checks

A mastery check is a short low-stakes assessment, consisting of 3 to 6
problems. Most mastery checks are online. Some may be in-class only,
completed on paper and graded by hand.

You are **not allowed to collaborate** on mastery checks. A mastery check is
something you do on your own, to prove, both to me and to yourself, that you
have learned the material from that unit. Collaboration on mastery checks is
cheating, and grounds for disciplinary action.

When you are ready to attempt a mastery check, send me a DM on GroupMe, and I
will send you a link with a password. **This link is for your use alone. Do not
share this link or password with other students.** For in-class mastery checks,
ask me in class, and I will hand you a mastery check to take. You cannot
request more than one in-class mastery check in the same period, and you
cannot request an in-class mastery check if there is less than 15 minutes left
in the class period.

If you wish to retake a mastery check, talk to me. First, we will make sure
that you understand what went wrong, and so aren't likely to repeat your
mistakes. Then, I'll give you a new version of the mastery check to take.
Typically, the individual problems on each mastery check are aligned: you only
need to complete the problems you got wrong on your previous attempts.

There are three limits on retakes:

1.  There is a mandatory waiting period between attempts: you cannot take or
    retake the same mastery check twice in one day.
2.  You are only allowed two *retakes* total each week: not two per unit, but
    two across all units.
3.  Some mastery checks expire, which puts further limits on retakes (see below for details).

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
6 Select all and only the true claims from this list:
| It is okay to collaborate on mastery checks, as long as the final answer is your own.
| If you fail a mastery check, you can retake it again that same day
| You are allowed more than two retakes each week, as long as they are spread across different units
| If a friend needs a link to retake and hasn't gotten a response from the professor, you can help out by sharing a retake link with them
```

## Pace, Due Dates, and Expiration Dates

By design, this class *must* be self-paced. Many students struggle mightily
with this, quickly fall behind, and fail.

To help keep you on track some of the early reading assignments have set due
dates: the reading for this unit is due by 11:55 pm on Friday of the first
week of classes; the reading for unit 01, by Friday of week two; for unit 02,
by Friday of week three; for unit 03, by Friday of week four.

These due dates as goads meant to keep you from falling completely off the
rails. **This is not my recommended pace**. I recommend is that you complete
units 00, 01, and 02 as quickly as possible. Things only get harder. Get ahead
early, and bank time to work through the more difficult later units.

Readings for later units are due by 5pm on Friday, May 5th. This is Friday of
the last week of classes. Again, this has nothing to do with recommended pace.
It just reflects the fact that, once we get deeper into the course, your job
is to complete as many units as you can. There is no fixed pace that works
well for all students.

Some but not all mastery checks have *expiration* dates. For example, the
expiration date for the mastery check for this unit is the end of Friday of
the second week of classes. Expiration dates are not due dates: you can still
take and complete a mastery check after it has expired. Instead, expiration
dates change the rules for retakes: after a mastery check has expired, you can
only take it once, whether that is for the first time, or one last retake.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
7 Select all and only the true claims from this list:
| *After a mastery check has expired, you can still take it one more time
| To succeed in this course, you just need to pay attention to the due dates
| Once a mastery check has expired, you are not allowed to take it
| *Many students struggle to stay on track with this course, because it is self-paced
```
## Finals Week

There is no final for this class. All reading assignments are due at or before
Friday, May 5th, at 5pm.

After that time, the class shifts into "Finals Week mode". You are no longer
able to complete readings, but you are allowed one last chance at the mastery
checks, including mastery checks that have expired. There are two limits on
this:

-   1 attempt per unit: you are only one finals week attempt per unit, whether
    that is your first attempt or a retake.
-   5 attempts total: you are allows a maximum of 5 attempts total across all
    units.

Online mastery checks can be requested any time before 5pm on Wednesday, May
10th, and completed any time before 5pm on Friday, May 12th. In-class
mastery checks can only be requested and attemped during the scheduled Final
Exam period.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
8 Select all and only the true claims:
| It is okay to share online mastery check links to help out a friend
| If you haven't completed the reading for a unit by May 5th, you can still complete that unit by taking the mastery check during Finals Week
| *During Finals Week, you can retake an expired mastery check, even if you have already attempted it after its expiration date
| Nothing for this class is due until the last day of classes, May 5th at 5pm
```

## Collaboration Units

Genuine engagement, participation, and collaboration are hard to measure.
Schemes that "bean count" participation tend to motivate folks just to do
the bare minimum, which is counterproductive.

Attendance is a necessary but not sufficient condition for engagement,
participation, and collaboration. I hope that, if I can get you to attend, I
can get you engage and collaborate. It may sound cheesy, but I want us to come
to together into a friendly and supportive community of folks working together
to learn logic. Trust me, learning logic is easier when you are part of such a
community.

For each class you attend, you earn 10 "collaboration points". Your first 100
collaboration points earn you one complete collaboration unit. Your second 100
collaboration points earn you a second collaboration unit. These are real
units: they count toward your total complete units, for the purpose of
calculating your grade. (No, there is no way to "master and complete" these
units.)

I recognize that there are legitimate reasons to miss class. Note that you can
miss several classes and still earn both collaboration units.

## Drop-In Office Hours

My drop-in office hours are times that I set aside, so that students can drop
in and ask for help. You do not need to make an appointment. You can just
drop-in. If you cannot make my drop-in office hours, ask for an appointment.

You can also use drop-in office hours to take or retake an in-class only mastery check.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
9 Drop-in office hours are
| by appointment only
| a time for me to be alone in my office without being bothered by students
| *times when you can drop by and ask for help
| *times when you can drop by without an appointment
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
10 The best way to contact me about this course is
| via shortwave radio
| *via GroupMe
| via email
```

The answer to question 10 can be found near the beginning of the syllabus, if
you missed it the first time through.

## Common Challenges and Barriers to Success

Many students arrive in this class who have an unhappy history with math. If
that is you, you seen and you are not alone.

There is no getting around the fact that this class is in part a math class,
and can trigger old anxieties and open old wounds. I assure you, formal logic
is objectively *much simpler* than high school algebra. Also, formal logic is
freestanding and its own thing: it does not presuppose or build upon high
school algebra in any way. Many people who are "bad at math" turn out to be
great at logic.

This class involves thinking about language in a math-y way,
and thinking about math in a language-y way.
It combines ways of thinking that you have been taught to keep separate
(for no good reason, as far as I can see).
This tends to make everyone uncomfortable!
Students who identify as "good with language" but "bad at math"
 struggle with the "math-y" bits.
Students who identify as "good at math" but "bad with language"
 struggle with the "language-y" bits.
Students who think of themselves as good at both
 often still struggle when asked to put both together.

Finally, this is not a course in abstract theory, and it is not a class that
asks you to memorize and regurgitate facts.
It is a course that asks you to learn *how* to solve different kinds of
problems. Learning *how* to do something takes *practice*, and practice takes
*time*. The course is designed to maximize your opportunities to practice,
both inside and outside of class,
and maximize your opportunities to get help as you practice.
But I cannot maximize your *time*: that is a limited resource that you will
need to manage.


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
11 This class might be challenging for you because
| *it combines both mathematics and language
| it will be taught entirely in French 
| it is a course in abstract theory
| *learning how to solve the problems takes practice, and practice takes time
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=11}
C'est la seule partie de ce cours qui est en français.

## Carnap.io

The readings and assignments for this course are all on Carnap.io. Carnap is a
tool for automatic machine grading of complicated logic problems. It is free,
but you will need a Google account to sign in. If you are reading this, presumably you
have already succeeded at doing this!

For the record: to enroll in Carnap, follow this link:

-   <https://carnap.io/enroll/ISU_112_SPRING_2023>

-   If you don't already have a Google account, you can [create one for
    free](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp).
-   When you create your account on Carnap, you will be asked for your name
    and your University ID.
    -   Use your preferred name. If that\'s different from the name that will
        show up on my official roster, I'll figure it out.
    -   For your University ID, use your **ULID**, not your **UID**. Your ULID
        is the first part of your ISU email address. Your UID is your nine
        digit student ID number.

If you already have an account on Carnap from a previous course, you will be
asked if you want to change your enrollment, and join this new course,
ISU_112_SPRING_2022. That is what you want to do. So click on the \"Change
Enrollment\" button.

## Reggienet

You can track your progress on individual assignments on Carnap by looking at
the progress bar at the top of each assignment. You should see this bar now,
at the top of this page. If you click on that bar, you can see more useful
information about this assignment.

You can also go to your [User Page](https://carnap.io/user) on Carnap, where
you can find a list of assignments, and, if you scroll down, a list of each
problem that you have submitted for each assignment.

For an overview of your progress through the course, you should instead go to Reggienet's gradebook. There you can find a breakdown of how many units you have completed and how many you have completed and mastered, as well as a tally of your collaboration points. If you scroll down, you can also see a "score" for each unit: 0 means incomplete, 1 means complete, 2 means complete and mastered. Next to that score, you should see, in the comments, a break down of your reading percentage and mastery check percentage for each unit.

Unfortunately, the Reggienet gradebook cannot be updated automatically from
Carnap. This is something I need to do manually, so it will tend to lag behind
your actual progress in the course. I try to manually update the gradebook at
least once a week, and more frequently than that as we near the end of the
term.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
12 The Reggienet gradebook
| will automatically stay in sync with Carnap, so if my scores don't show up on the Reggienet gradebook immediately, something has gone wrong
| *needs to be updated manually, so newly completed work will not show up immediately on Reggienet
```

## Accommodations

Any student needing to arrange a reasonable accommodation for a
documented disability should contact Student Access and Accommodation
Services at 350 Fell Hall, 309-438-5853,
<http://studentaccess.illinoisstate.edu>.

I'm happy to work with you.

Also, if you come across accessibility issues with Carnap or other course materials,
 please let me know.

## Other Sources of Support

Life at college can get complicated. If you're feeling stressed, overwhelmed,
lost, anxious, depressed or are struggling with personal issues, do not
hesitate to call or visit Student Counseling Services (SCS). These services
are free and completely confidential. SCS is located at 320 Student Services
Building, (309) 438-3655.

If you are worried about a friend and don't know how to help, you can call SCS
and ask to speak to a counselor. The Kognito simulation, available through
SCS's webpage, can also help you learn how to assist your friend in connecting
to services.

Also, it's hard to learn if you're hungry or couch-surfing. If you are having
difficulty affording groceries, accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or
securing a safe and stable place to live, help may be available. I urge you to
contact the Dean of Students Office to learn more. One great resource
available to all students is the [School Street Food
Pantry](https://wp.me/P9Yf7W-u).

## Academic Misconduct

Academic integrity is expected and required. Students are expected to be
honest in all academic work. A student's placement of their name on any
academic exercise shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the
result of the student's own thought, effort, and study.

If you have questions, refer to the Code of Student Conduct, B1
(Academic Integrity), which outlines unacceptable behaviors in academic
matters, or talk to me. In certain circumstances (such as cheating or
plagiarism) I may be required to refer a student to Community Rights &
Responsibilities for a violation of Illinois State University's Code of
Student Conduct.
