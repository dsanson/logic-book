## Introduction

::: {.auto-tally}
:::

In this chapter, we return to the project we began in [Chapter 4](04R), of
translating between English and SL. The specific learning objectives for
this unit are:

a.  I can use commas to disambiguate structurally complex sentences, and
    guide my symbolization of those sentences
b.  I can symbolize sentences with compound subjects and predicates
c.  I can symbolize sentences involving restricted quantifier phrases
    using disjunctions and conjunctions

## Ambiguity Again

# [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844&ndash;1900) was a German philosopher and
cultural critic who published intensively in the 1870s and 1880s. He
is famous for uncompromising criticisms of traditional European
morality and religion, as well as of conventional philosophical ideas
and social and political pieties associated with modernity. Many of
these criticisms rely on psychological diagnoses that expose false
consciousness infecting people&rsquo;s received ideas; for that
reason, he is often associated with a group of late modern thinkers
(including Marx and Freud) who advanced a &ldquo;hermeneutics of
suspicion&rdquo; against traditional values (see Foucault [1964] 1990,
Ricoeur [1965] 1970, Leiter 2004). Nietzsche also used his
psychological analyses to support original theories about the nature
of the self and provocative proposals suggesting new values that he
thought would promote cultural renewal and improve social and
psychological life by comparison to life under the traditional values
he criticized.</p>
</div>
:::

Natural languages are among the most fascinating of all human artifacts.
Nietzsche, quoted above in the epigraph, where he complains that "the origin
of language did not happen logically", also famously described language as an
unwieldy pile of metaphor, poetry, rhetoric:

> A mobile army of metaphors,
> [metonyms](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metonymy){target="_blank"
> rel="noopener noreferrer"}, anthropomorphisms, in short a totality of human
> relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified,
> transferred, and decorated, and which after long use people think are fixed,
> canonical, and binding. ("On Truth and Lie in an Extra-moral Sense"
> [p. 6](https://archive.org/details/NietzscheOnTruthAndLie){target="_blank"
> rel="noopener noreferrer"}).

And yet, with a bit of work, we can uncover the hidden logical form
communicated by a sentence. And we can capture and display that form in our
artificial language, SL, a language that is emphatically *not* a creature of
metaphor or metonym; a language that is devoid of poetry and rhetorically
limp. In other words, a language that most certainly is above all else
*logical* in its origin.

The last time we discussed translation, we confined ourselves to the basic
building blocks. We noted that 'if' marks an antecedent, 'only if' marks a
consequent, and 'if and only if', which puts them together, indicates a
biconditional. We discussed all the ways we have of expressing *surprising*
conjunctions: 'but', 'however', 'nevertheless', and so on. And this short
review would be incomplete unless we mentioned that 'unless' means 'or' and
the awkwardness in translating 'neither...nor...' into symbols.

In this chapter, we take a step further into the messiness of English as a
natural language. First, we consider the way that a comma can be used to
indicate, if not force, one reading over another. Then we look at compound
subjects ('Cardi and Megan') and compound predicates ('rich and famous'), some
of the trouble they cause, and some of the problems they solve. Finally, we
turn to consider quantificational phases, like 'all of us' and 'some of us',
and how we might try to capture what they mean using our sentential
connectives.

## Ambiguity in Sentences involving 'if' and 'not'

Ambiguity is the
[bugbear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugbear){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"} of the Logician! If only natural languages were as
clean and precise as our artificial language!

This sentence has two readings:

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that the pot will boil if you watch it.
:::

'It is not the case that' expresses a negation, and it negates the complete
grammatical sentence that begins with the word after 'that'. But in this case,
there are two equally good candidates. We can read it as negating 'the pot will boil':

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that [the pot will boil]{.wavy} if you watch it.
:::

But we can also read it as attaching to the entire conditional:

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that [the pot will boil if you watch it]{.wavy}.
:::

There is nothing in this English sentence to decide between these two
readings.

Can you see how the two readings differ in meaning? The first is an instance
of the old adage: *a watched pot never boils*. The second denies you the
superpower of being able to boil water with your eyes.

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| W: You watch the pot
| P: The pot will boil
:::

We can use parentheses to disambiguate the English, or we can translate into
SL:

::: {.transl}
| (It is not the case that the pot will boil) if you watch it.
| $W\rightarrow\neg P$

| It is not the case that (the pot will boil if you watch it).
| $\neg(W\rightarrow P)$
:::

We can also rewrite the English sentence into "Canonical"
English, and so remove the ambiguity:

::: {.transl}
| (If you watch the pot, then it is not the case that the pot will boil)
| $W\rightarrow\neg P$

| It is not the case that (if you watch the pot, then the pot will boil)
| $\neg(W\rightarrow P)$
:::

The canonical English renderings remain unambiguous when we drop
the parentheses. Specifically, notice the difference between:

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that (the pot will boil if you watch it).
| It is not the case that (if you watch the pot, then the pot will boil)
:::

The first becomes ambiguous when the parentheses are dropped, but the second
does not. This is because of the way that the phrase 'it is not the case'
interacts with the 'if'. Remember, 'it is not the case that' negates the
complete grammatical sentence that begins with the word after 'that'. In the
second sentence, the only such *complete* grammatical sentence is 'if you
watch the pot, then the pot will boil'. The phrase 'if you watch the pot'
*contains* a complete sentence, but is not itself complete, since it needs
another clause, expressing a consequent, to complete it.

We can also use our old trick of moving the negation down next to the verb:

::: {.transl}
| (It is not the case that the pot will boil) if you watch it.
| The pot will not boil if you watch it.
| $W\rightarrow\neg P$
:::

But this only works for the one reading, where the negation negates a simple
sentence. We can't use this trick when we *want* to express the negation of
a conditional.

Here are some examples, meant to give you a chance to stop and think through
what you've just read.

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| P: You are a Packers fan
| R: You hate the Bears
| W: You grew up in Wisconsin
:::

Here is another structurally ambiguous sentence in English:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears.
:::

This sentence has two 'if's in it. Each 'if' marks an antecedent. So the
sentence involves two conditionals, one inside the other. But there is more
than one way to assign antecedents to each 'if'.

Focus just on the first 'if'. One option is that the antecedent it introduces
is 'You are a Packers fan':

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan]{.wavy} if you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears
:::

But another option is that the ancedent it introduces is 'You are a Packers
fan if you grew up in Wisconsin':

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin]{.wavy} you hate the Bears
:::

Those are both grammatically complete sentences. Nothing in the English tells
us which one is marked as antecedent by that first 'if'.

What about the second 'if'? Again, there are two sentences it might mark as
antecedents:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan if [you grew up in Wisconsin]{.wavy} you hate the Bears
| If you are a Packers fan if [you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears]{.wavy}
:::

So we get two possible readings:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan (if you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears)
| $P\rightarrow(W\rightarrow R)$

| If (you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin) you hate the Bears
| $(W\rightarrow P)\rightarrow R$
:::

We can translate back out to "Canonical" English, which yields two unambiguous
English sentences:

::: {.transl}
| (If you are a Packers fan, then (if you grew up in Wisconsin, then you hate
  the Bears))
| $P\rightarrow(W\rightarrow R)$

| (If (if you grew up in Wisconsin, then you are a Packers fan), then you hate
  the Bears)
| $(W\rightarrow P)\rightarrow R$
:::

And, again, we can drop the parentheses in the Canonical English, and our
sentences remain unambiguous.

Can you see the difference in meaning between these two claims? The first says, roughly,
that you hate the Bears if you are a Packers fan who grew up in Wisconsin.
That is probably true, right? The second says, roughly, that you hate the
Bears if you would have been a Packers fan had you grown up in Wisconsin.
That' probably false, right? Lots of Bears fans who grew up in Chicago *would
have been* Packers fans *if they'd grown up in Wisconsin*. But that doesn't
mean that they actually hate the Bears!

Is this ambiguous?

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan *then* if you grew up in Wisconsin you
  hate the Bears.
:::

It is not. The first reading is available:

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan]{.wavy} *then* if you grew up in Wisconsin you
  hate the Bears.
:::

But the 'then' blocks the other reading: 

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan *then* if you grew up in Wisconsin]{.wavy} you
  hate the Bears.
:::

'You are a Packers fan then if you grew up in Wisconsin' is not a grammatical
sentence. So the only possible reading is the first reading:

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan]{.wavy} *then* if you grew up in Wisconsin you
  hate the Bears.
| $P\rightarrow (W\rightarrow R)$
:::

Is this ambiguous?

::: transl
| If [you are a Packers fan]{.wavy} if you grew up in Wisconsin *then* you
  hate the Bears.
:::

It is. In this case, the 'then' doesn't block either reading, so both readings
remain available:

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan]{.wavy} if you grew up in Wisconsin *then* you
  hate the Bears.
| If [you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin]{.wavy} *then* you
  hate the Bears.
:::

Another tool we can use to indicate structure is a comma. Notice how the comma
guides you in each case to one reading rather than the other:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan, if you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears.
| $(P\rightarrow (W\rightarrow R)$

| If you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin, you hate the Bears.
| $(W\rightarrow P)\rightarrow R$
:::
:::

There is no hard and fast rule in English about the use of commas to indicate
logical structure. But now that you are aware of this problem, *you should
always use commas in this way when you can.* It will make you a better writer.

::: vaside
The Comma Rule: When a sentence would otherwise be ambiguous, a comma
indicates a bigger structural break.
:::

For the purpose of translation into SL in this class, we will treat this as a
hard and fast rule, and we call it the [Comma Rule]{.vocab}.

Here is a short video lecture, going over the Comma Rule:

## Ambiguity in Sentences Involving 'And', 'Or', and 'If and Only If'

The comma rule is also helpful for resolving ambiguities in sentences
involving our other connectives too. For example, this sentence is ambiguous:

::: {.transl}
| People talk and rumors spread unless questions are asked.
:::

The two readings, disambiguated with commas, are:

::: {.transl}
| People talk and rumors spread, unless questions are asked.
| $(P\wedge R)\vee Q$

| People talk, and rumors spread unless questions are asked.
| $P\wedge (R\vee Q)$
:::

Do you see that these two sentences mean very different things, and how the
commas help disambiguate?

Again, this is ambiguous:

::: {.transl}
| She wins the prize if and only if she eats the most hot peppers and she has
  a high tolerance for spicy food.
:::

The two readings, disambiguated with commas, are:

::: {.transl}
| She wins the prize, if and only if she eats the most hot peppers and she has
  a high tolerance for spicy food.
| $P\leftrightarrow (Q\wedge S)$
| She wins the prize if and only if she eats the most hot peppers, and she has
  a high tolerance for spicy food.
| $(P\leftrightarrow Q)\wedge S$
:::

Only the second reading tells us that she has a high tolerance for spicy food,
full stop, and so gives us a reason to put our money on her to win the prize.
Paying careful attention to commas can save you money when gambling on eating
contests at bars.

## Compound Subjects and Predicates

:::aside
Here is a short video lecture covering the material from this section:

:::youtube
<https://youtu.be/EnqdZMmdgLc>
:::
:::

These sentences mean the same thing:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree and Malik talked to the press,
| Desiree talked to the press and Malik talked to the press.
:::

English craves brevity. When we want to apply the same predicate to more than one subject,
it is more convenient, and shorter, to apply the predicate ('talked to the press') once to a grammatically compound
subject ('Desiree and Malik'), instead of applying it twice, and then
combining the resulting sentences with a sentential connective.

The same thing happens when we want to apply two predicates to the same
subject:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree is imposing and tall,
| Desiree is imposing and Desiree is tall.
:::

But traps lurk. Do these sentences mean the same thing?

::: {.transl}
| Desiree and Malik are in love.
| Desiree is in love and Malik is in love.
:::

Perhaps on one reading of the first sentence, they do. But on the most natural
reading of the first sentence, it means that they are *in love with each
other*. The second sentence doesn't say that.

Here is an even more blatant example:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree and Malik are two people.
| Desiree is two people and Malik is two people.
:::

These are not equivalent at all! The first is reasonable. It says, of the two people
together, that taken as a pair, they are two. The second says of each person
separately that they are two, in the same sense that Vincent Adultman is not
one adult, but three kids stacked in a coat.

:::youtube

:::

## Compound Subjects, Predicates, and Ambiguity

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| P: The alarm went off
| Q: Desiree is awake
| R: Malik is awake
:::

One nice thing about compound subjects and predicates is that they can be used
to help clarify structure. For example,

::: {.transl}
| [Desiree and Malik are awake]{.wrap} if the alarm went off.
| $P\rightarrow (Q\wedge R)$
:::

There is no temptation to read this as:

::: {.transl}
| $Q\wedge (P\rightarrow R)$
:::

This is because, in English, compound subjects and predicates "group more
tightly" than sentential connectives. The use of the compound subject forces
the two parts of the conjunction to be grouped together.

:::

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| P: Polly squawks.
| Q: Polly wants a cracker.
| R: Rosie squawks.
| S: Rosie wants a cracker.
:::

```{.Translate .Prop points=10}

```

## Quantificational Claims

:::aside
::: youtube
<https://youtu.be/yDdGXYIAt4A>
:::
:::

:::soawrapper
::: soasticky
| R: Ruth liked the movie
| S: Sonia liked the movie
| T: Clarence liked the movie

We are Ruth, Sonia, and Clarence.
:::

Suppose there are exactly three of us: Ruth, Sonia, and Clarence.
Suppose we all go to watch a movie together. Did we all like the movie? Did
none of us like the movie? Or maybe some of us liked it, and same of us
didn't? Let's consider how we might symbolize these different claims.

::: {.transl}
| All of us liked the movie.
:::

The trick is to see that 'all of us' is equivalent to 'Ruth and Sonia and
Clarence'. So we can unpack the sentence into a conjunction:

::: {.transl}
| All of us liked the movie.
| Ruth and Sonia and Clarence liked the movie.
| Ruth liked the movie and Sonia liked the movie and Clarence liked the movie.
| $R\wedge S\wedge T$
:::

Suppose we didn't *all* like the movie. How can we symbolize that? The trick is
to see that 'not all of us liked the movie' is the negation of 'all of us
liked the movie'. So we can piggyback on our symbolization of 'all of us
liked the movie':

::: transl
| Not all of us liked the movie.
| $\neg (R\wedge S\wedge T)$
:::

Notice the distinction between that and:

::: transl
| All of us did not like the movie.
| Ruth and Sonia and Clarence didn't like the movie.
| Ruth didn't like the movie and Sonia didn't like the movie and Clarence didn't like the movie.
| ¬R ∧ ¬S ∧ ¬T
:::

The claim that not all of us liked the movie isn't the same as the claim that
all of us didn't like the movie. Maybe not all of us liked it, but some of us
did. What about:

::: transl
| At least one of us liked the movie.
:::

Here, the trick is to see that 'at least one of us' is equivalent, in
this situation, to 'Ruth or Sonia or Clarence'. So:

::: transl
| At least one of us liked the movie.
| Ruth or Sonia or Clarence liked the movie,
| Ruth liked the movie or Sonia liked the movie or Clarence liked the movie.
| R ∨ S ∨ T
:::

What about the possibility that *none of us* liked the movie? How can we
symbolize that?

::: transl
| None of us liked the movie.
:::

There are two ways to think about this. You can think of it as equivalent to
'All of us didn't like the movie', which we already translated above:

::: transl
| All of us did not like the movie.
| Ruth and Sonia and Clarence didn't like the movie.
| Ruth didn't like the movie and Sonia didn't like the movie and Clarence didn't like the movie.
| ¬R ∧ ¬S ∧ ¬T
:::

Or, we can think of 'none of us' as the *negation of* 'at least one of us'.

::: transl
| None of us liked the movie.
| It is not the case that at least one of us liked the movie.
| It is not the case that (Ruth or Sonia or Clarence liked the movie).
| $\neg (R\vee S\vee T)$
:::

Notice that these two ways of handling 'none of us' mirror the two ways we
have to handle 'neither...nor...':

::: transl
| Neither Ruth nor Clarence liked the movie
| $\neg R\wedge \neg T$
| $\neg (R\vee T)$
:::

We've considered four sentences:

::: transl
| All of us liked the movie.
| Not all of us liked the movie.
| At least one of us liked the movie.
| None of us liked the movie.
:::

What about,

::: transl
| Some of us liked the movie.
:::

We will treat this as equivalent to "at least one of us liked the movie"

::: transl
| Some of us liked the movie.
| R ∨ S ∨ T
:::

There are two common objections to this. First, in many situations, 'some'
implies *more than one*:

> A: "Did any of your friends show up to your birthday party?" 
>
> B: "Some of them did." 
>
> A: "Oh! Good! How many?" 
>
> B: "Well, actually, just Gary."

At a minimum, B's initial response was misleading, suggesting that more than
one of their friends came to the party.

Second, in many situations, 'some' implies *not all*:

> A: "Did any of your friends show up to your birthday party?"
>
> B: "Some of them did." 
> 
> A: "Oh! Good! How many?" 
>
> B: "Well, actually, all of them did."

Again, at a minimum, B's initial response was misleading.

But notice that we have in English the phrase 'some
but not all'. That suggests that 'some' doesn't already mean 'not all'.
Otherwise, the phrase would be redundant. 

And imagine this dialogue:

> A: "How did you do on the test?"
>
> B: "I've only checked my scores on the first two questions. I got those
> correct. So I know that I got some of the questions correct."

Notice that B's use of 'some' clearly does not imply *not all* in this
context. So it seems like if 'some' implies 'not all', it does so in
some but not all contexts.

In the 1970s, Paul Grice, a philosopher of language, provided a compelling
account of what is going on here. This account is part of his theory
of "Conversational Implicature". Grice thinks that in conversation, we expect
speakers to be generally cooperative, and follow a few basic "maxims". One of
his maxims is:


Maxim of Quantity
:   Be as informative as required.


When B said "Some of my friends came to the party" even though all of them
came to the party, she violated this maxim. She ought to have been more
infomrative, and said that all of them came. It isn't that what she said was
*false*, even though it was misleading.

Again, when B said "Some of my friends came to the party" even though only
Gary showed up, she violated this maxim. She ought to have been more
informative, and said that just one came. It isn't that what she said was
*false*, even though it was misleading. 

On the other hand, when B said, "I got some of the problems correct," it was
clear that B was in no position to know whether or not she got all of them
correct, and so this was as informative as she could be. In that context, the
felt implication, that 'some' means 'not all', disappears entirely.

Implicature](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/) for more

So that's a bit of theory. But the key takeaway is that, for us in this course, 'some' just
means 'at least one'.
