-   [ ] add manual light/dark theme switch
-   [ ] fix illegible text colors in dark mode - I think maybe it is mostly
    about the green used for "correct" backgrounds and the light colored text
    used in dark mode.
-   [ ] figure out what to do about the chapter 2 roadblock (soundness and
    validity)
-   [ ] consider splitting up the derivations chapters: maybe a super simple
    intro to the rules/super simple derivations without show lines, followed
    by simple derivations of all three types, followed by subderivations.
    Consider adding new rules for the other connectives along the way, rather
    than as a later dump. Consider dropping the derived rules chapter
    altogether?
-   [ ] consider splitting up some of the translation chapters
-   [ ] video lectures for *every section*
-   [ ] *more* open-ended questions
-   [ ] more *exposition* in the exercises too.
-   [ ] MCs generated from question pools on demand
-   [ ] Matrix for course chat?
