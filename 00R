# Introduction

:::

In my classes, I use Unit 00 as the syllabus, and as an opportunity to
introduce the students to how Carnap works, and how each unit of the class is
constructed. So the syllabus includes integrated required reading questions,
and is followed by a few "exercises", and a "mastery check", which is
essentially just a syllabus quiz.

Here are some examples:

-   [Fall 2022](00R_f22) (draft)
-   [Spring 2022](00R_s22)

I am only now figuring out how to manage multiple concurrent "versions" of the
same course on Carnap. I need this primarily to manage students who take an
"incomplete" in one term, and so still need access to the previous term's
version of the course.

My current solution is to use the following naming scheme for uploaded course files:

-   01R: 01R_s22, 01R_f22

For Fall 2022, I also plan to take advantage of the option in Carnap of
specifying a "title" for each assignment that is distinct from the uploaded
file name, and so `01R_f22`, for example, will be assigned the title, `01R`.
The URL for an assignment on Carnap uses the "title", not the filename, so
this will present students with cleaner URLs.
