:::: epigraph
"Logic is not the knowledge of the use nor construction of arguments, but
rather the knowledge of discerning and judging them correctly, namely why some
are valid and some are invalid."

[Peter Abelard, *Logica "Nostrorum petitioni sociorum"*, ca. 1124-1125]{.source}
::::

:::

## Introduction

In the previous unit, 
 we introduced the concept of an *argument*, 
 consisting of *premises* and a *conclusion*. 
In this unit, 
 we turn to the *evaluation* of arguments: 
 what makes a *good* argument good, 
 and a *bad* argument bad?
We introduce three new concepts:
 [validity]{.vocab},
 [soundness]{.vocab},
 and [strength]{.vocab}. 

We introduce soundness and strength to put them aside.
The rest of this book is a deep-dive exploration of validity. 
Specifically, it is a deep-dive exploration of [formal validity]{.vocab},
 that is,
 validity that can be explained in terms of [logical form]{.vocab}.

## Validity

[Some arguments]{.newthought} are "airtight" or "secure",
 while other arguments are not.
The cookie jar argument from the last chapter is "airtight":

::: standardform
-   This jar contains both chocolate chip cookies and sugar cookies.
-   If you take any two cookies at random from the jar, at least one of them
    will be a sugar cookie.
-   There is one chocolate chip cookie in the jar.
:::

The conclusion of this argument *follows* from the premises in an absolute
way.
That is, assuming the premises are true, 
 it follows that there *must* be exactly one chocolate chip cookie in that jar.

The Che Guevara t-shirt argument from the last chapter is not "airtight" in
this sense:

::: standardform
-   That dude is wearing a Che Guevara t-shirt.
-   That dude is a communist.
:::

The conclusion of this argument does not *follow* from the premise in an
absolute way.
That is, even assuming the premise is true,
 the conclusion might be false.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
1 Can you describe a way that the premise could be true, but the conclusion false?
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=1}
Maybe the dude is wearing the t-shirt just because he's a hipster,
 but he's not a communist.
Or maybe he is wearing the t-shirt for some other reason.
:::

A [valid]{.vocab} argument is an "airtight" argument:
 an argument for which there is no possible "gap" 
 between the truth of the premises
 and the truth of the conclusion;
 if the premises are true, then the conclusion *must* be true too.
An argument that is not "airtight" is invalid.

In logic, 
 'valid' is a technical term,
 with a carefully defined meaning.
Outside of logic,
 can mean other things:
 a valid driver's license is one that has not expired;
 a valid opinion is one that might be false,
 but isn't beyond the pale.
But in logic,
 we never use the word 'valid' to describe an opinion.
*Opinions* are either *true* or *false*.
Only *arguments* can be *valid* or *invalid*.

It is pretty easy to see that the t-shirt argument isn't valid.
But the cookie jar argument is kind of complicated.
It takes some reasoning to convince yourself that it is valid.
But for some arguments, it is pretty easy to see that they are valid:

:::standardform
-   All cows moo.
-   Bessie is a cow.
-   Bessie moos.
:::

I don't know if it is true or not that all cows moo.
Maybe some cows chose to be quiet?
And I don't know who or what Bessie is, 
 so I don't know if it is true that Bessie is a cow,
 and I don't know if she moos.
But I do know this:
 *if* it is true that all cows moo,
 *and* it is true that Bessie is a cow,
 *then* it *must also* be true that Bessie moos.
In other words,
 I know that this argument is valid.

By contrast,
 this argument is *not* valid:

:::standardform
-   All cows moo.
-   Bessie moos.
-   Bessie is a cow.
:::

Again,
 I don't know whether or not the premises are true.
And I don't know whether or not the conclusion is true.
But I can think of a way that the premises *could* be true,
 without the conclusion also being true.
So I know it's not valid.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
2 Can you describe a way that the premises of this argument could be true, without the conclusion also being true?
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=2}
Here is one way: suppose Bessie is a mooing moose. Or suppose she is a mooing
preschooler, pretending to be a cow.
:::

Here is a silly argument:

:::{.standardform}
-  Babies are illogical.
-  Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile.
-  Illogical persons are despised.
-  Babies cannot manage crocodiles.
:::

:::aside
This example is from Lewis Carroll (1896) *Symbolic Logic*, Book VIII, Ch 1, ยง9.
Carroll's books on logic have many funny examples like this,
 but also several racist, sexist, and anti-semitic examples.
:::

This argument is silly.
But, if you think about it,
 you can see that it is valid.
The premises are ridiculous,
 but it is not possible that the conclusion be false,
 assuming the premises are true.
Like the cookie jar argument,
 this argument is kind of complicated.
It might take some reasoning to convince yourself that it is valid.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
3 Try to reason from the premises of this argument to its conclusion, and convince yourself that the conclusion follows from the premises.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=3}
Here is a stab at it:

First step:

-   Suppose it is true that illogical people are despised, and suppose it is also true babies are illogical.
-   Then it follows that babies are despised.

Second step:

-   Suppose it is also true that nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile.
-   Then it follows that babies, since they are despised, cannot manage crocodiles.

So we can reasoning, in two steps, from the premises to the conclusion.
:::

[Validity]{.newthought} is a complicated concept.
You cannot figure out whether or not an argument is valid
 by figuring out whether or not its premises are true,
 or whether or not its conclusion is true.
Validity is a *hypothetical relationship* between the premises and conclusion:
 *if* the premises *were* true, 
 does the conclusion *have to be* true too?

Here is another way of thinking about it:
 to say that an argument is valid
 is to say that it is *guaranteed* to *preserve truth*.
That means that,
 *necessarily*,
 if the premises are true,
 then the conclusion is also true.
In other words, it means that
 *it is impossible* for
 all the premises to be true
 and the conclusion false.

:::stickywrapper
:::{.vaside .sticky}
Validity
:   An argument is [valid]{.vocab} if and only if it is impossible for all of
    its premises to be true and its conclusion false.
:::

This is our official definition of validity: an argument is
[valid]{.vocab} if and only it is impossible for all of its premises to be
true and its conclusion false.

Consider the following argument:

::: standardform
-  Most dogs are well-behaved.
-  Fletch is a dog.
-  Fletch is well-behaved.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
4 Is this argument valid?
| Yes, it is valid.
| *No, it is invalid.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=4}
This argument is invalid.
It is possible for both premises to be true and the conclusion false.
For example, suppose most dogs are well-behaved,
 but Fletch is one of the exceptions:
 a dog who is not well-behaved.
:::

What about:

::: standardform
-  All dogs are well-behaved.
-  Fletch is a dog.
-  Fletch is well-behaved.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
5 Is this argument valid?
| *Yes, it is valid.
| No, it is invalid.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=5}
This argument is valid.
It is not possible for both premises to be true and the conclusion false.
If *all* dogs are well-behaved, 
 and Fletch is a dog, then Fletch must be well-behaved.
The difference between this and the previous argument is the
difference between 'most' and 'all':
 'most' allows for exceptions;
 'all' does not.
:::

What about:

::: standardform
-  All dogs are well-behaved.
-  Fletch is well-behaved.
-  Fletch is a dog.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
6 Is this argument valid?
| Yes, it is valid.
| *No, it is invalid.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=6}
This argument is invalid. 
Assume both premises are true.
That does not guarantee that Fletch is a dog.
Fletch might be a well-behaved cat,
 or a well-behaved child.
:::

What about this argument?

::: standardform
-  Only dogs are well-behaved.
-  Fletch is well-behaved.
-  Fletch is a dog.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
7 Is this argument valid?
| *Yes, it is valid.
| No, it is invalid.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=7}
This argument is valid.
If we assume that *only* dogs are well-behaved,
 and we assume that Fletch is well-behaved,
 then Fletch must be one of the dogs.
He can't be a well-behaved cat:
 if he were, then it would be false that *only* dogs are well-behaved.
The difference between this and the previous argument is the difference
between 'all' and 'only'.
:::

Here is another silly argument from Lewis Carroll. 
Is it valid?

:::{.standardform}
-  All cats understand French.
-  Some chickens are cats.
-  Some chickens understand French.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
8 Is this argument valid?
| *Yes, it is valid.
| No, it is invalid.
```
:::{.reaction .correct ex=8}
This argument is valid.
Both premises are actually false,
 and it is absurd to imagine them to be true.
But in the absurd situation where they are both true,
 the conclusion must be true as well:
 if all cats understand French,
 and some chickens are cats,
 then those cat-chickens must also be francophones.
Imagine a world in which all the cats understand French. 
Walk up to any cat and ask,
 'Parlez-vous Franรงais?'
That cat, if it is honest, will answer, 'Oui.'
This includes any cats who also happen to be chickens.
::::

What about this argument:

:::{.standardform}
-  All cats understand French.
-  Some chickens understand French.
-  Some chickens are cats.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
9 Can you describe the "gap" that makes this argument invalid? That is, can you describe a way that the premises could be true without the conclusion being true?
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=9}
Here is one way: 
 Suppose all the cats live in Paris, and speak French. 
 And suppose all the chickens live in Canada, where some of them speak French,
 but some of them don't.
Nothing about these two assumptions forces us to posit chicken-cats.
So this is a way that the premises could both be true, 
 without the conclusion being true.
:::

What about this argument?

:::{.standardform}
-  All citrus are fruits.
-  All lemons are fruits.
-  All lemons are citrus.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
10 Is this argument valid?
| Yes, it is valid.
| *No, it is invalid.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=10}
One striking feature of this argument is that the premises are all true,
 and the conclusion is true too.
But that doesn't make it valid.
Validity isn't about whether or not the premises and conclusion *happen* to be
true together;
 it is about whether they *must* be true together.
Or, rather, it is about whether the conclusion *must* be true in any situation
in which the premises are.

To see the gap, 
 imagine that scientists discovered lemons are not a type of citrus,
 but are more closely related to figs,
 and their apparent similarity to citrus is just the result of
 convergent evolution.
In this situation, both premises would be true,
 but the conclusion would be false.
:::

What about:

:::{.standardform}
-  All citrus are fruits.
-  All lemons are citrus.
-  All lemons are fruits.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
11 Is this argument valid?
| *Yes, it is valid.
| No, it is invalid.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=11}
Again, all the premises are true,
 and the conclusion is true too.
But this time, the argument is valid,
 because in this case,
 the truth of the premises is enough to *guarantee* the truth of the
 conclusion.
:::

## Soundness

:::stickywrapper
:::{.vaside .sticky}
Validity
:   An argument is [valid]{.vocab} if and only if it is impossible for all of its
    premises to be true but its conclusion false.

Soundness
:   An argument is [sound]{.vocab} if and only if it is valid **and** all of its premises
    are actually true.
:::

To say that an argument is valid is to say that, *if* the premises are all
true, that is enough to *guarantee* that the conclusion is true too. 
So *if* you start from true premises, and you reason in accordance
with a valid argument, it is guaranteed that you will reach a true conclusion.

But that's a big "if"! 

Here is a valid argument for the existence of God:

::: standardform
-  If something that created the universe, God exists.
-  Something that created the universe.
-  God exists.
:::

We can all agree that this argument is valid:
 necessarily, *if* the premises are both true, *then* the conclusion must be
 true too.
But are the premises both true?
If not, then this argument gives us no reason to believe that God exists.

When you are evaluating arguments,
 with an eye to figuring out what you should believe,
 you care about more than validity.
You want to know whether or not the premises *actually are true*.
If they are,
 you also want to know whether or not the argument is valid.
If both these conditions hold,
 you can be confident that the conclusion is true.

When both of these conditions hold,
 we say that an argument is sound:

Soundness
:   An argument is [sound]{.vocab} if and only if it is valid **and** all of its premises
    are true.
:::

That argument about cats and chickens speaking French is valid, 
 but it isn't sound. 
It isn't sound because the premises are false.
And that argument about babies and alligators is valid,
 but it also isn't sound.
Perhaps it's true that babies are illogical,
 but it is not generally true that illogical persons are despised.
And, given what I know about Florida Man,
 I suspect there are some rather despicable folks who know how to manage
 crocodiles.

The argument we were just looking at,
 for the existence of God,
 is also valid.
But it is hard to say whether or not it is sound.
Is it true that something created the universe?
Is it true that, if something did, that thing is God?
Until we know the answers to those questions,
 we won't know whether or not the argument is sound.

Soundness is validity **PLUS** something more. 
So every sound argument is valid, but not vice versa. 
Remember, validity is a *hypothetical* relationship
 between the premises and conclusion: 
 if the premises *were* true, 
 the conclusion *would have to be* true too. 
An argument is sound when that hypothetical relationship holds 
 **AND** the premises *actually are* true. 
So if you know that an argument is sound, 
 you can infer that its conclusion is true:

:::standardform
-   Necessarily, if the premises of this argument are true, then the conclusion is true too.
-   The premises of this argument are true.
-   The conclusion of this argument is true.
:::

Suppose you have a roommate, Marco, who is a gossip.
He tells you that Monte cheated on his boyfriend Charles.
You aren't sure whether or not to believe Marco:
 is he a reliable source?

There are two dimensions to your worry about Marco.
First, you might worry about the reliability of his *sources* of information:
 How did he come upon this information?
 Is there reason to think his sources were telling the truth?
Second, you might worry about his reliability as a *transmitter* of information:
 Is he prone to distorting or misreporting what his sources told him,
 so that, even when his sources told him the truth,
 there is no guarantee that what he is telling you is true?

In the same way, there ar two dimensions you should worry about,
 when faced with an argument.
First, you should worry about the *truth of the premises*:
 are they actually true?
Or does this argument start from false assumptions?
Second, you should worry about the *validity of the argument*:
 supposing the premises were true,
 can we trust this argument to preserve that truth,
 so that the conclusion is true as well?

An argument is *sound* when it passes muster on *both* of these dimensions.

Just as two friends can feed you contradictory gossip,
 two arguments can have contradictory conclusions.
When two friends feed you contradictory gossip,
 you know that one of them must be wrong,
 and so you know that either they had faulty sources,
 or they misreported what their sources said.
When two arguments have contradictory conclusions,
 you know that one them must not be sound:
 either it has at least one false premise,
 or it isn't valid.

For example, here is an argument for the existence of God:

::: standardform
-  If something that created the universe, God exists.
-  Something that created the universe.
-  God exists.
:::

Here is an argument against the existence of God:

:::standardform
-   If God exists, then there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally
    perfect being.
-   If there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect being,
    then that being would prevent any evil from occurring in the world.
-   Evil occurs in the world.
-   God does not exist.
:::

Both arguments are valid. 
But their conclusions cannot both be true. 
So at least one of them has at least one false premise.

If this were a philosophy textbook, 
 rather than a logic book, 
 we would now spend time exploring each premise,
 trying to figure out which premise(s) are false.
But this is a logic book. 
Logic doesn't have much to say about what is or isn't actually true. 
But it has a lot to say about what is or isn't valid.
So, for the rest of this book,
 we put aside *soundness*,
 and focus only on *validity*.

:::

## Inductive Strength

:::stickywrapper
:::{.vaside .sticky}
Inductive Strength
:   An argument is [inductively strong]{.vocab} if and only if it is **not
    valid**, but the premises, if true, would **provide a good reason** to accept
    the conclusion.
:::

[Some arguments]{.newthought} are pretty good, even though they aren't valid. For example,

::: standardform
-   Most NBA players are tall.
-   James Wiseman is an NBA player.
-   James Wiseman is tall.
:::

This argument is pretty good, but it is not valid.
It is not valid, because Wiseman might be one of the exceptions:
 a short NBA player, like Muggsey Bogues,
 who was only 5'3".
It is pretty good because,
 if all you know about Wiseman is that he is an NBA player,
 then, given that *most* NBA players are tall,
 it is a good bet that Wiseman is too.

Validity is an *iron-clad guarantee*:
 if the premises are true, the conclusion *must* be true as well.
But most of our reasoning involves evidence that *supports* a conclusion,
 but falls short of providing any such iron-clad guarantee.
When the premises *support* the conclusion,
 but don't *guarantee* the conclusion,
 we say the argument is [inductively strong]{.vocab}.

Sometimes, philosophers make a distinction 
 between arguments that are meant to be inductively strong,
 and arguments that are meant to be valid.
Arguments that are meant to be inductively strong are said to be "inductive arguments".
Arguments that are meant to be valid are said to be "deductive arguments".

Sometimes, philosophers call the study of inductive strength,
 and inductive arguments,
 "inductive logic".
And they call the study of validity,
 and deductive arguments,
 "deductive logic".
Other philosophers argue that the study of inductive strength
 is the domain not of logic,
 but of probability theory and statistics.

Whatever labels we use,
 the important point is that the formal methods use to study validity
 do not usefully extend to the study of inductive strength.
So, for the rest of this book,
 we put inductive strength aside.

:::

## Assessing Validity and Soundness

If I give you an argument, and I ask you whether or not it is sound, I am
really asking you two questions:

-   Is it valid?
-   Are all of its premises actually true?

So, for example, is this argument sound?

::: standardform
-   All ducks are birds.
-   All birds are dinosaurs.
-   All ducks are dinosaurs.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
12 Is this argument valid?
| *Yes!
| No!
13 Are all of its premises true?
| *Yes!
| No!
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=12}  
The argument is valid. 
If all the ducks are birds, 
 and all the birds are dinosaurs,
 then it must be that all the ducks are dinosaurs. 
:::

:::{.reaction .correct ex=13}  
As a matter of fact,
 both of these premises are true.
Didn't know that birds are dinosaurs?
See "[Are Birds Dinosaurs?](https://www.livescience.com/are-birds-dinosaurs.html){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}"
:::


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
14 Is this argument sound?
| *Yes!
| No!
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=14}
Since it is valid,
 and all the premises are true,
 the argument is sound.
:::

Here is another argument to consider:

::: standardform
-   If it is raining, then the streets are wet.
-   The streets are wet
-   It is raining.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
15 Is this argument valid?
| Yes!
| * No!
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=15}
Remember, the way to show that an argument is no valid is to find a "gap":
 a way that the premises could be true without making the conclusion true.
In this case, there are several such gaps.
Here is one:
 suppose it has recently stopped raining, 
 and the streets are still wet.
Here is another:
 suppose the snow melt in the mountains
 has caused the river to overflow,
 flooding the streets.
Here is a third:
 suppose the city is hosing down the streets,
 to manage dust.
These are all ways that the premises could both be true,
 but the conclusion false.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
16 Is this argument sound?
| Yes!
| * No!
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=16}  
Since the argument is not valid, 
 it is not sound.
Remember, soundness is validity **PLUS** something more.
So any argument that is not valid is not sound.
:::

## Two Unexpected Consequences of Our Definition of Validity

:::stickywrapper
:::{.vaside .sticky}

Validity
:   An argument is valid if and only if it is *impossible* for all of its premises to be true
    but its conclusion false.
:::

As we've seen, validity is *guaranteed truth preservation*: 
 if all of the premises are true, 
 and the argument is valid, 
 there is an **absolute guarantee** that the conclusion is true too.
In other words,
 there is *no possible way* for the premises all to be true without the
 conclusion also being true.
Or, in the words of our official definition:
 it is impossible for all the premises to be true but the conclusion false.

With that in mind, consider this weird argument, with contradictory premises:

::: standardform
-  God exists.
-  God does not exist.
-  The moon is made of green cheese.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
17 Is this argument valid?
| *Yes!
| No!
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=17}  
I imagine that right now,
 you either quite satisifed with yourself for getting that right,
 or you are very confused about how that can be the right answer.

The premises of this argument are inconsistent:
 it is impossible that they both be true.
That means that there is no possible way for them to be true together.
And since there is no possible way for them to be true together,
 there is no possible way for them to be true together *and* the conclusion
 false.
So the argument is valid.

By our definition, 
 any argument with inconsistent premises is automatically valid.
:::

Here is another weird argument. 
Notice that it's conclusion is a logical truth,
 and cannot be false:

::: standardform
-  Grass is green
-  Snow is white
-  If it rains, it rains
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
18 Is this argument valid?
| *Yes!
| No!
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=18}  
The conclusion of this argument is a necessary truth:
 there is no possible way that it could be false.
That means that 
 there is no possible way that it could be false 
 when the premises are both true.
So the argument is valid.

By our definition,
 any argument with a necessary truth as its conclusion is automatically
 valid.
:::

These are two weird "degenerate" cases of validity:
By our definition, 
 any argument with inconsistent premises is automatically valid.
And by our definition,
 any argument with a necessary truth as its conclusion is automatically
 valid.

It might be helpful to remember that validity is about *preserving truth*:
 a valid argument should never take us from true inputs,
 to a false output.
When the premises of an argument contradiction each other,
 the inputs of that argument can never all be true.
So that argument can never take us from true inputs
 to any output, true or false.
And when the conclusion of an argument is a necessary truth,
 the output of that argument can never be false.
So that argument can never take us to a false output
 from any input, true or false.

Suppose you are an engineer, 
 tasked with building a machine 
 that takes, as input, a colored card.
 and gives, as output, a colored card.
And suppose you are told that the machine must follow one rule:
 it must preserve yellowness.
That is, when the input card is yellow,
 the output care must also be yellow,
 in every possible situation.

And suppose you are lazy.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
19 Describe the laziest possible implementation of such a machine, as best you can.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=19}
Obviously, there are many possible answers.
Here is one:

> Place an empty cardboard box on your desk,
>  and label it "INPUT".
> Place another cardboard box on your desk,
>  and label it "OUTPUT".
> Fill the "OUTPUT" box with yellow cards.
>
> Directions to user: 
>  place input card into the input box;
>  remove output card from output box.

Notice that this machine is guaranteed to preserve yellowness:
 no matter what card you put into the input box,
 you will receive a yellow card from the output box.
So, when you put a yellow card into the input box,
 you will receive a yellow card from the output box.

This is analogous to the way in which an argument whose conclusion is a
necessary truth is guaranteed to preserve truth.

Here is a second design:

> As before, place two cardboard boxes on your desk,
> and label one "INPUT" and the other "OUTPUT".
> Burn all yellow cards.
> Fill the "OUTPUT" box with a random assortment of cards.

This machine is also guaranteed to preserve yellowness,
 but only because we have made it impossible to input a yellow card.
This is analogous to the way in which 
 an argument whose premises are inconsistent
 is guaranteed to preserve truth.

But the laziest solution of all is the one box solution:

> Place one box on your desk.
> Instruct users to place their card into the box,
>  and then remove that card from the box.

This machine also preserves yellowness. 
It is analogous to an argument that preserves truth,
 and so is valid,
 because its conclusion is identical to its premise:

:::standardform
-   Grass is green.
-   Grass is green.
:::

## Formal Validity

Much of this section is adapted from the later parts of [Chapter
1](/book/1#validity) and the earlier parts of [Chapter 2](/book/2) of the
Carnap Book.
:::

Once you begin to think about validity, you may notice something
interesting. Consider these two arguments:

::: standardform
-   If the mouse isn't in the trap, the cat ate it.
-   The mouse isn't in the trap.
-   The cat ate the mouse.
:::
::: standardform
-   If the moose isn't in the trap, the wolf ate it.
-   The moose isn't in the trap.
-   The wolf ate the moose.
:::

These are both valid. As is this one:

::: standardform
-  If it isn't broken, I want to buy it.
-  It isn't broken.
-  I want to buy it.
:::

Do you see what these three arguments all have in common? They all have the
same structure or *logical form*.

:::vaside
[Logical form]{.vocab}: very roughly, what similarly structured arguments have in common.
:::

One way of depicting the logical form of the three arguments above is as follows:

:::liveshapes
::: standardform
-  If [ ]{.P}, then [ ]{.Q}.
-  [ ]{.P}
-  [ ]{.Q}
:::

Plug any declarative sentence into the [ ]{.P}, and any declarative sentence
into the [ ]{.Q}, and the result is a valid argument.

This form of argument is called *Modus Ponens*. Any argument with the form
Modus Ponens is valid. Don't take my word for it. Give it a try yourself. Click on one of the [ ]{.P}'s, and type in a random
declarative sentence. Then click on one of the [ ]{.Q}'s, and type in a random
declarative sentence. Do you agree that the resulting argument is valid?
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
20 What argument did you come up with?
```

When an argument is valid in virtue of its logcial form, we say that it is [formally valid]{.vocab}.

:::vaside
An argument is [formally valid]{.vocab} if and only if it is valid in virtue
of its logical form.
:::

Recall this invalid argument:

:::{.standardform .liveshapes}
-  If [it is raining]{.P}, then [the streets are wet]{.Q}.
-  [The streets are wet]{.Q}.
-  [It is raining]{.P}.
:::

Before, we offered an *informal* explanation of its invalidity:
 it is invalid because there are ways that the premises could be true,
 without the conclusion being true.
For example, 
 we pointed out that 
 it might have recently stopped raining, 
 so the streets are still wet.

But we can also offer a *formal* explanation of its invalidity. 
First, notice that the form of this argument is not *Modus Ponens*.
Instead, this is a form we call *Affirming the Consequent*:

:::flex
:::ruledisplay
**Modus Ponens**

:::{.standardform .liveshapes}
-  If []{.P}, then []{.Q}.
-  []{.P}.
-  []{.Q}.
:::
:::

:::ruledisplay
**Affirming the Consequent**

:::{.standardform .liveshapes}
-   If []{.P}, then []{.Q}
-   []{.Q}
-   []{.P}
:::
:::
:::

Affirming the Consequent is not a valid form of argument.
That is,
 while there are some instances of this form that might happen to be valid,
 no argument is valid in virtue of having this form.

Here is an instance of Affirming the Consequent that obviously fails to
preserve truth:

:::{.standardform .liveshapes}
-  If [St. Louis is in Illinios]{.P}, 
   then [St. Louis is in the United States]{.Q}.
-  [St. Louis is in the United States]{.Q}.
-  [St. Louis is in Illinois]{.P}.
:::

The premises are both true, but the conclusion is false.
This argument form is called *Affirming the Consequent*.

Let's see if you can recognize the difference between the two forms. First,
consider this argument:

:::standardform
-   If it itches, then it is healing.
-   It is healing.
-   It itches.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
21 Is this argument an instance of Modus Ponens or Affirming the Consequent?
| Modus Ponens
| *Affirming the Consequent
22 Is this argument valid or invalid?
| Valid
| *Invalid
```


:::{.reaction .correct ex=21}
If you just guessed randomly to get the correct answer,
 scroll up and try plugging the two component sentences,
 "it itches" and "it is healing",
 into the two patterns,
 to confirm that this matches the pattern of Affirming the Consequent,
 but does not match the pattern of Modus Ponens.
:::

What about this argument? Do you see how it differs in form?

:::standardform
-   If it itches, then it is healing.
-   It itches.
-   It is healing.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
23 Is this argument an instance of Modus Ponens or Affirming the Consequent?
| *Modus Ponens
| *Affirming the Consequent
24 Is this argument valid or invalid?
| *Valid
| Invalid
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=21}

:::

This suggests a research project: 
 let's find all the argument forms that make an argument valid.
Better, let's not just make a long list.
Let's work out the basic principles--
 the principles that let us determine,
 for any given argument,
 whether it is formally valid.
That is the plan for the rest of this book:
 to construct a *theory* of formal validity.

## Conclusion

This chapter introduced the basic concepts used to evaluate arguments:
 [validity]{.vocab}, [soundness]{.vocab}, and [inductive strength]{.vocab}.
Going forward, we put aside soundness and inductive strength
 and focus just on validity.
More precisely,
 we will focus on [formal validity]{.vocab}: validity that can be explained in
 terms of [logical form]{.vocab}.
