# Syllabus and Course Mechanics: Supplement

Many units have *supplements*, like this. 

Sometimes, you will complete the reading and complete all the reading exercises, but still need more practice. That's what supplements are for: they will typically include lots more practice exercises. Sometimes, they will also include additional explanations and other enrichment materials, like links to youtube videos and the like.

Supplements are not required. Nothing you do in a supplement can be submitted for credit, and nothing is worth any points. Use the supplements when they are helpful to you, and ignore them when they are not.
