# Derivation Playgrounds

This is not an assignment and it is not worth any points or credit.

A derivation playground allows you to derive any valid argument of your
choice. There are no set premises, and there is no set conclusion. Start by
entering a show line for your desired conclusion. Then proceed as usual,
helping yourself to your desired premises. Once you have successfully
constructed a derivation of that conclusion from those premises, the argument
you have derived will be displayed above the derivation.

## Playgrounds for SL

Here are two playgrounds for SL. Why two? In case you want to
play with two different derivations at the same time.
