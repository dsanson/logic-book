# Derivation Playgrounds

This is not an assignment. It is a derivation playground. Or, rather, it is a
page containing derivation playgrounds. A derivation playground is like a
derivation exercise, but there is no set argument to derive. You can use it to
try to derive anything you'd like.

Start a derivation by entering a show line in the usual way. Since there is no
set problem, you can enter a show line for whatever you want to try to derive.
And, since there is no set problem, you can use whatever premises you want.

When the derivation is complete, the playground will display the argument that
you have derived. 

## Sentential Logic Playground

These two playgrounds are for Sentential Logic. Why two? In case you want to
play with two different derivations at the same time.

```{.Playground .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
```

```{.Playground .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
```

## Predicate Logic Playground

These two playgrounds are for Predicate Logic.

```{.Playground .FirstOrder options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
```

```{.Playground .FirstOrder options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
