# Syllabus and Course Mechanics: Exercises

::: auto-tally
:::

Usually, the exercises will be an opportunity to practice things you've
learned in the reading. Since this unit is just about getting our feet wet,
and understanding how the course works, these exercises are instead open-ended
questions, meant to give me a chance to get to know you.

As usual, you get full credit for submitting any answer to an open-ended question, 
 even if it is something like 'Fuck off Sanson, none of your business'. 
I will not be grading your answers. 
But in this case, I will *read* all your answers.
So this is a genuine opportunity to reach out to me.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
1 What do you think logic is?
2 Do you have any questions about how the "mastery grading" scheme works for this course?
3 Is there anything that you've especially appreciated from your past professors?
4 Is there anything you'd like me to know about?
```
