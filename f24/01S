# Introducing Arguments (Supplement)

This is a supplement. It is not worth any points, and does not affect your
grade. It includes more practice problems along with additional resources and
explanations.


## External Resources

For another take on the same material covered in this chapter, see chapter 1 of:

-   Andrew Lavin, *[Thinking Well](https://csuchico.app.box.com/v/LavinThinkingWell)*.

We will not be making serious use of argument maps in this course, but they
are a very useful tool, especially if you are interested in reconstructing
complex dialectical situations---that is, situations in which you are
considering several arguments for and against some position, along with
arguments for and against the premises of those arguments. There are several
resources for constructing mind maps, and several textbooks that include their own 
take on how they should be constructed. I rather like "Philosophy Mapped", which includes both a 
short primer and free online software:

-   Simon Cullen, [Philosophy Mapped](https://maps.simoncullen.org/home)

If you are interested in applying the ideas introduced in this chapter
to your readings in other philosophy classes, I highly recommend the following (free) book,
which introduces a slightly more flexible version of standard form, and quickly ramps things up from there:

-   Alex Rajczi, *[Primer on Argument Analysis](https://wp.me/P8zY7I-9y)*.

For a lovely series of video lectures on logic, see this YouTube playlist:

-   Sara Uckelman, [What is Logic?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbEJNppcCD6VCbl-sWPGtjV7jnK_PIiYj)

The first few videos overlap with the material from this chapter.

## Premise Markers and Conclusion Markers

As you learned in the reading, some words and phrases are often used to mark a
premise, and some words and phrases are often used to mark a conclusion. 
You can use these words to help identify premises and conclusions.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer submission=none options="check"}
1 List as many premise-indicating words and phrases as you can.
2 List as many conclusion-indicating words and phrases as you can.
```

:::spoiler
Premise indicating words and phrases include:

-   since, because, given that, for, it follows from the fact that, the reason
    being...

Conclusion indicating words and phrases include:

-   so, therefore, hence, ergo, thus, consequently, which proves that, I
    conclude that, which allows us to infer that, it follows that,...

## Practice

What follows are a bunch of passages, meant to give you practice in
identifying premises and conclusions, and reconstructing arguments in standard
form. For an extra challenge, attempt to identify implicit premises as well.

*explanation of why* they disagree. Remember that many of our keywords are
only *sometimes* used to mark premises or conclusions. They can also be

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer submission=none}
68 Try to write down the definition of validity without looking it up. Then check your answer.
69 Try to write down the definition of soundness without looking it up. Then check your answer.
```

Those definitions are important. Especially the definition of validity. Here are some questions designed 
to push and prod on your grasp of the concepts:

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer submission=none}
70 Come up with your own example of an argument that is sound.
71 Come up with your own example of an argument that is valid, but not sound.
72 Come up with your own example of an argument that is not valid, but is inductively strong.
73 Come up with your own example of an argument that is neither valid nor inductively strong.
74 Come up with your own example of an argument that is neither valid nor inductively strong, but has true premises and a true conclusion.
75 Come up with your own example of an argument that is valid, but has a false conclusion.
76 Come up with your own example of an argument that is not valid, but has a true conclusion.
77 Come up with your own example of an argument that is valid, even though the conclusion doesn't seem to have anything to do with the premises.
78 Come up with your own example of an argument that is valid, but has all true premises and a false conclusion.
```

## Recognizing Validity and Soundness

These exercises simply don't lend themselves to being set up as problems on
Carnap. So I give them to you as exercises to do on paper, with some answers,
hints, and comments hidden behind spoiler boxes.

For each of the following, mark each premise and conclusion as true (T), false
(F), or don't know (?). Then decide whether or not the argument is valid,
whether or not it is sound, and whether or not it is inductively strong. If
you think an argument is *invalid*, try to describe for yourself a possible
situation in which the premises are true and the conclusion is false.

-   It rains.
-   It pours.
:::

:::spoiler
::: standardform
-   False: If it rains, it pours.
-   ?: It rains.
-   ?: It pours.
:::

The first premise is false. Sometimes, when it rains, it just sprinkles. 

As I write this, where I am, the second premise is false too. But it might be
true where you are, as you solve this problem. The same goes for the
conclusion.

The argument is valid, but it isn't sound. It is valid because if the premises
are true, the conclusion has to be true too. It isn't sound, because at least
one of its premises is false.

::: standardform
-   True: If you live in Normal, you live in Illinois.
-   True?: You live in Illinois.
-   ?: Your live in Normal.
:::

The first premise is true. I suspect that the second premise is true too, but
you are in a better position to know that than I am. I don't know whether or
not the conclusion is true: I know  you are a student at ISU, but you might
live in another town.

The argument is not valid. To see this, suppose you lived in Chicago: then both premises
would be true, but the conclusion is false. 

And since it is not valid, it is not sound.

Is it strong? No: most people who live in Illinois do not live in
Normal. So if the only thing I knew about you was that you lived in Illinois,
and the only thing I knew about Normal was that Normal was in Illinois, that
wouldn't provide me with a good reason to think that you live in Normal.

Not valid. Suppose the premises are both true, and Fido is a cat. Also not
strong. The first premise says that most dogs go to heaven, it
doesn't say that most who go to heaven are dogs. It could be that most dogs go
to heaven, and most ants go to heaven too. There are far more ants than dogs,
so in that situation, the fact that Fido goes to heaven doesn't give you much
reason to think he is a dog rather than an ant.

Not valid. Fido could be an exception: one of the dogs who doesn't go to
heaven.

But the argument is strong: if most dogs go to heaven, and Fido is
a dog, then, in absence of specific reasons to think that Fido is an
exception, it is a good bet that Fido is probably going to heaven.

Not valid. The first premise says that all the books in the library are worth

The premise is true, and the conclusion is true. The argument is not valid: it
is *possible* that, despite the lack of evidence, Nessie exists. But the
argument is strong, I think, especially given how much effort has
gone into to trying to find such evidence over the years.

Is this one strong also? Does the lack of evidence *against* the
existence of Nessie count in support of Nessie's existence?

Valid! The first premise is true. The second is harder to assess: what do you
think? And the third is also hard to assess, but seems pretty plausible. But
if you agree that all three premises are true, I am afraid that working
through this supplement may lead to your eventual financial ruin.

## Sarah's Argument

At the beginning of the reading for chapter 1, I asked you to watch this video clip and answer some questions:

:::illustration
![Sarah's Puzzle](https://dsanson.github.io/logic-materials/vid/labyrinth-clip.mp4)
:::

The questions were:

1.  What is the conclusion that Sarah comes to?
2.  What is the information that she reasons from?
3.  Was her reasoning correct, or did she make a mistake?

Sarah's conclusion is that the right door leads to the castle. Call the guard
on Sarah's left "Lefty" and the guard on her right "Righty". Sarah reasons
from three pieces of information---that is, three premises:

-   One of the doors leads to the castle, and the other leads to certain
    death.
-   One of the guards always tells the truth and the other always lies. 
-   Lefty says that Righty would say that the left door leads to the castle.

So we can represent her argument in standard form like so:

::: standardform
1.  One of the doors leads to the castle, and the other leads to certain
    death.
2.  One of the guards always tells the truth and the other always lies. 
3.  Lefty says that Righty would say that the left door leads to the castle.
4.  The right door leads to the castle.
:::

Notice that this representation of her *argument* does not yet represent how
she *reasoned* from those premises to that conclusion. An argument, as we have
defined it, consists of some premises, which are the *starting points* for
someone's reasoning, and the conclusion, which is the *end point* for their
reasoning, but it does not include the *path* from those starting points to
that end point.

Here is an attempt to represent that path:

-   Given (2), either Lefty always lies and Rightly always tells the truth, or vice versa.
-   Suppose Lefty always lies and Righty always tells the truth.
    -   Then what Lefty says in (3) is a lie.
    -   So Righty would say that the right door leads to the castle.
    -   ...and Righty would be telling the truth...
    -   So the right door leads to the castle.
-   Suppose instead that Lefty always tells the truth and Righty always lies.
    -   Then what Lefty says in (3) is true.
    -   So Righty would say that the left door leads to the castle.
    -   ...but Righty would be lying...
    -   So the right door leads to the castle.
-   So, either way, the right door leads to the castle.

This reasoning establishes that Sarah's argument is indeed valid. So, if she
made a mistake, it was not a logical mistake. Perhaps one of her premises was
false?

If you enjoy logic puzzles like this, you might enjoy picking up any one of
several books by Raymond Smullyan, such as his *What is the Name of this
Book?*
