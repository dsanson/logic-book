## Objectives

This chapter introduces the concept of an argument, in the logical sense, and
several key concepts we use to study and talk about arguments.

The learning objectives for this unit are:

-   You have a working understanding of what an argument is.
-   You know the technical definitions of each of the following terms:
    [argument]{.vocab}, [premise]{.vocab}, [conclusion]{.vocab},
    [strength]{.vocab}, [validity]{.vocab}, and [soundness]{.vocab}.
-   Given a short passage that contains an argument, you can identify its
    premises and conclusion, and rewrite it in standard form.

The mastery check for this unit is on paper. When you are ready to attempt it,
ask me, either in class or during office hours.

## Introduction

To help fix ideas, watch the short clip below (from the movie [Labyrinth
(1986)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/){.source target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"}). In the clip, Sarah is given some information,
asks some questions, and then comes to a conclusion. When pressed by the
guards, she then explains her reasoning, showing how her conclusion follows
from the information she was given. She then acts on that conclusion (and
immediately falls into a pit).

As you watch it, I want you to think about the structure of her reasoning, and
whether she is right, or she has made a mistake. Also, Sarah talks really
fast! I would recommend enabling captions, and replaying the clip a few times,
possibly at a lower speed. (Click on the gear icon in the video controls to 
access these options.)

![Sarah's Puzzle](https://dsanson.github.io/logic-materials/vid/labyrinth-clip.mp4)
:::

After you have watched the video, answer the following questions as best you
can. It is okay if you are not sure about your answers. We are just getting
started! The point here is not to get the right answers, but to start thinking
about what the right answers might be.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
1    What is the conclusion that Sarah comes to?
2    What is the information that she reasons from?
3    Was her reasoning correct, or did she make a mistake?
```

We return to Sarah's argument and these questions at the end of this
chapter, once we have introduced some basic tools for reconstructing and
evaluating arguments.

## Arguments

In one sense of the word, an argument is a verbal fight between two or more
people: a lovers' quarrel; a shouting match with your mom. That is not how we
will use the word 'argument' here. The sort of argument we are interested in
is an attempt to provide a *reason* in support of a *conclusion*, like when
someone says something controversial, and you say, "Okay, but what is your
*argument* for that?"

What is it to offer an argument in this sense, a reason in support of conclusion?
To get us started, here are three reasons one might offer against majoring in philosophy:

-    A major in philosophy won't get you a good job;
-    Philosophy is nothing but idle speculation.
-    The Lizardman majored in philosophy.

::: aside
:::illustration
![The Lizardman](https://dsanson.github.io/logic-materials/img/the-lizardman.jpg){alt="A portrait of Erik Sprague, also know as the Lizardman, displaying his forked tongue as well as several of his tatoos, including a tatoo that reads 'Freak' across his chest."}
:::

[The
Lizardman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lizardman_(performer)){.source
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} is an American freak show and
sideshow performer, best known for his body modifications, including sharpened
teeth, a full-body tattoo of green scales, a bifurcated tongue, subdermal
implants, and green-inked lips. He has a BA in Philosophy from Hartwick College.
:::

These are three separate reasons, each in support of the same conclusion. So this gives us
three separate arguments:

Argument 1
:    **Reason**: A major in philosophy won't get you a good job. **Conclusion**: You
    shouldn't major in philosophy.

Argument 2
:   **Reason**: Philosophy is nothing but idle speculation. **Conclusion**: You
    shouldn't major in philosophy.

Argument 3
:   **Reason**: The Lizardman majored in philosophy. **Conclusion**: You
    shouldn't major in philosophy.

Here is a simple visual representation of the three arguments, using what is known as an "argument map":

end
</pre>

We might also consider reasons one might offer in favor of majoring in philosophy. Here are three:

-   Philosophy explores fundamental questions about the world and our place in it.
-   Philosophy develops uniquely powerful ways of thinking about especially complex and intractable problems.
-   The Lizardman majored in philosophy.

This gives us three more arguments:

Argument 4
:   **Reason**: Philosophy explores fundamental questions about the world and our place in it.
    **Conclusion**: You should major in philosophy.

Argument 5
:   **Reason**: Philosophy develops uniquely powerful ways of thinking about especially complex and intractable problems.
    **Conclusion**: You should major in philosophy.

Argument 6
:   **Reason**: The Lizardman majored in philosophy. **Conclusion**: You
    should major in philosophy.

Here is an argument map, visually representing these three arguments:

intractable problems.")

end
</pre>

I am not saying that these are *good* arguments, just that
they are *arguments*. Again, an argument is *an attempt* to provide a reason in
support of a conclusion. Whether or not that attempt is successful is a
further question.

## Articulating Reasons into Premises

In the previous section, I introduced six different reasons for and against
majoring in philosophy, and separated them into six different arguments. But
the presentation of each argument was incomplete. More work needs to be done
to articulate each of the six reasons, and clarify how each reason is meant to support its conclusion.

::: aside
It is important to note that the claim that philosophy majors don't get good
jobs is [not supported by the
data](https://www.apaonline.org/general/custom.asp?page=data){.source
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. But for the moment, we are just
interested in how, if this *were* true, it *would* support the conclusion, and
so put aside the fact that it is false.
:::

Consider Argument 1: you should not major in philosophy because it won't get
you a good job. This argument trades on the well-known fact that philosophy
majors end up working fast food, while students who pursue more practical
majors land real jobs. It is important to note that this claim is [not
supported by the
data](https://www.apaonline.org/general/custom.asp?page=data){.source
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. But for the moment, I want you to
put that aside. Suppose this *were* true. How is that meant to support the
conclusion, that you should not major in philosophy? What *else* to have to assume
to see this as a reason against majoring in philosopy?

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
4    What else do we have to assume, if we are taking the claim that a major in philosophy won't land you a good job as a reason you should not major in philosophy?
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="4"}
There are a few different possible assumptions that would do the trick. One is
that the primary purpose of a college degree is landing a good job. Another is
that, while that might not be the primary purpose of a college degree for
*everyone*, it needs to be the primary purpose of a college degree for *you*,
you given the details of your financial situation. Yet another is that, while that might not
be *your* primary purpose, "it is the only reason *we* (i.e., your parents)
are paying for this!"
:::

When people give arguments, they often leave key assumptions unstated. But if we want
to understand their reasons, we need to know what those assumptions are. 
Figuring this out is often more art than science. You need to guess, based
upon what was said, what else they had in mind.

Here is one version of Argument 1, stating explicilty the unstated assumption:

-   **Reason**: A major in philosophy won't get you a good job. You should choose a major that will get you a good job. **Conclusion**: You
    shouldn't major in philosophy.

And here is how we can represent that using an argument map:

<pre class="mermaid">
%%{init: {"theme":"base","themeCSS": "#Argument rect{stroke:transparent; fill:#e5e5e5} #Argument span {color:transparent} .edgeLabel{color:#888; font-size:0.9em; margin-right:3px} .edgeLabel i{color:crimson} .edge-pattern-dotted{stroke:crimson} .edge-pattern-solid{stroke:green} #flowchart-pointEnd{fill:green}  g[id*=\"O\"] *{stroke:crimson!important; font-size:0.95em} circle+g span{color:white; } circle{fill:green!important} g[id*=\"C\"] * {fill:black;color:white;font-weight:bold}","themeVariables":{"secondaryColor":"transparent","primaryColor":"white","primaryBorderColor":"black"},"flowchart":{"htmlLabels":true,"padding":20,"rankSpacing":20}} }%%
flowchart TB
subgraph Argument
direction TB
C(["You should not major in philosophy."])
a("A major in philosophy
won't get you a good job.")
b("You should choose
a major that will
get you a good job.")
a & b --- 1((+))
1 -->|supports|C
end
</pre>

Notice how the map represents the idea that the *two* claims *work together*
to support the conclusion. Those *two* claims are the two parts of a *single*
reason: neither supports the conclusion on its own; but they support the
conclusion when taken together.

We call the parts of a reason the [premises]{.vocab} of the argument.
Sometimes when people offer a reason, they explicitly state each premise, that
is, each part of the reason. But often, they leave one or more premises
implicit and unstated. All six of the arguments described above are like this.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
5    If someone says that you should not major in philosophy because it is nothing but idle speculation, what implicit premise(s) are they relying on?
6    If someone says that you should not major in philosophy because the Lizardman did, what implicit premise(s) are they relying on?
```

Here is a map of Arguments 1-3, with some suggested implicit premises:

<pre class="mermaid">

d("Idle speculation

e("You shouldn't major

c & d & e --- 2((+))
f & g --- 3((+))
1 -->|supports|C
2 -->|supports|C
3 -->|supports|C
end
</pre>

The key thing I want you to notice here is that there are *three* reasons,
each articulated into more than one premise, and that the premises that make
up a reason *work together* to provide a reason in support of the conclusion.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
7    If someone says that you should major in philosophy because it explores fundamental questions about the world and our place in it, what implicit premise(s) are they relying on?
8    If someone says that you should major in philosophy because it develops uniquely powerful ways of thinking about especially complex and intractable problems, what implicit premise(s) are they relying on?
9    If someone says that you should major in philosophy because the Lizardman did, what implicit premise(s) are they relying on?
10   I've suggested that the fact that the Lizardman majored in philosophy might be offered both as a reason for majoring in philosophy and as a reason against majoring in philosophy. How can that be? 
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="10"}
The difference lies in the unstated implicit premises. One natural suggestion
is that someone using this as an argument *against* majoring in philosophy
thinks that it is obvious that you don't want to surround yourself with people
like *that*, while someone using this as an argument *for* majoring in
philosophy thinks it is obvious that you do.

## The Abstract Form of an Argument

Every argument has two parts: the reason, which can be represented as a set of
premises, and the conclusion. So the abstract form of an argument is:

$$\{P_1, P_2, \dots\} \ \therefore C$$

The '∴' symbol can be read as 'therefore', and marks $C$ as the conclusion. So
this represents a set of premises $\{P_1, P_2, \dots\}$, leading to a
conclusion, $C$.
In practice, when we represent arguments like this, we will usually omit the braces around the set,
and simply list the premises, followed by the conclusion:

$$P_1, P_2, \dots \ \therefore C$$

Another common way to represent arguments is known as 
[standard form]{.vocab}:


:::{.standardform .centeredbox}
-   $P_1$
-   $P_2$
-   $\vdots$
-   $C$
:::

Here, we list the premises *vertically*, followed by the conclusion. And we
mark the difference between premises and conclusion both with '∴'
("therefore") and with a horizontal line.

For example, here is how we might represent Argument 6 in standard form (supplying suitable implicit premises):

:::{.standardform .centeredbox}
-   The Lizardman majored in philosophy.
-   The Lizardman is a deviant freak.
-   Deviant freaks are your people.
-   You should major in philosophy.
:::

Standard form shares some of the visual suggestiveness of an argument map, but
is more compact, and it works best when we are considering *one* argument
rather than *several* interconnected arguments. We will be making heavy use of
standard form in this class.

:::
:::sec

## Declarative Sentences

Both the premises and the conclusion of an argument must be *declarative*
sentences. A declarative sentence is a sentence that is used to make a claim
or assertion, as opposed to sentences that are used to ask questions or issue
commands. For example, 'Grass is green' and 'The world is flat', as opposed to
'Are we there yet?' and 'Mow the lawn!'

This is because it is only declarative sentences that encode *information*,
and only declarative sentences that can be true or false. When I argue that
you should major in philosophy because the Lizardman did, I am bringing some
information to your attention---information that can be expressed by a set of
premises---and suggesting that this information supports the truth of my
conclusion.

::: aside
FWIW, I share the view of John Corvino, that the fact/opinion distinction, as taught
in American schools, is "pernicious and should be
consigned to the flames." See his short essay, "[The
Fact/Opinion
Distinction](https://www.philosophersmag.com/essays/26-the-fact-opinion-distinction){.source
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"},"
*The Philosopher's Magazine*, 2015.
:::

The distinction between declarative and non-declarative sentences is *not* the
distinction between sentences that express "facts" and sentences that express
"opinions". We use declarative sentences to express both: 'Grass is green' is
a declarative sentence, but so is 'MCU movies are bad' and 'Good people don't
lie to their friends.' This is important, because we provide reasons in
support of our opinions all the time, and we want to be able to represent
those arguments too. For example, "MCU movies are bad because they are
bloated, have poor visual effects, and are badly scripted," and "Good people
don't lie to their friends because friendship is sacred and lying is a form of
betrayal." Again, you don't have to think that these are *good* arguments to
recognize that they are *arguments*.


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
11.   Which of the following are declarative sentences, and so suitable to serve as premises or conclusions of arguments?

| *The Beatles are overrated.

## Identifying Premises and Conclusions

Not everything is an argument. Here is a passage about Hicks Dome, an ancient volcanic formation in southern Illinois: 

> Hicks Dome is a geological feature in Hardin County.
> The Hicks Dome is underlain by ultramafic igneous rocks and igneous
> diatremes or breccia pipes. Most geologists accept the theory that the older
> rocks at the center of the uplift are a result of this deep-seated igneous
> activity. This activity may also have provided the fluorine in the fluorspar
> deposits in the region. Fluorspar, or calcium fluoride, was mined in Hardin
> County until the early 1990s.
> [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardin_County,_Illinois#Geography)


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
12.  Is this an argument?
| Yes
| *No
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="12"}
This is not an argument. It describes Hicks Dome, and recounts the standard geological
explanation for how it formed.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
13. What about: "Haters gonna hate, but I'm just gonna shake it off."
| This is an argument.
| 'Haters gonna hate' is a premise of this argument.
| 'I'm just gonna shake it off' is the conclusion of this argument.
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="13"}
This is not an argument. Swift is not offering a reason in support of a
conclusion. She is just saying that while it is true that haters are going to
hate, she is going to ignore those haters, and shake off their hating.
:::

Often, when someone offers an argument, they will use certain keywords to indicate what they are up to.
For example, 'because' often indicates that someone is offering a premise.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
14. What about: "God exists, <strong>because</strong> without God everything would be meaningless."
| *This is an argument.
| 'God exists' is a premise of this argument.
| *'Without God everything would be meaningless' is a premise of this argument.
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="14"}
This is an argument, offering a reason to believe that God exists. The word
'because' here indicates that 'without God everything would be meaingless' is
a premise, meant to support the conclusion, 'God exists'.
:::

Another keyword is 'so', which often marks a conclusion.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
15   This is an argument. "You are a full-time student and work long hours, <strong>so</strong> it would be a bad idea for you to get a dog." Can you write it in standard form?
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="15"}
The passage offers a reason why it would be bad for you to get a dog. The word
'so' marks 'You shouldn't get a dog' as the conclusion, and 'You are a
full-time student and work long hours' is the premise offered in support of
that conclusion:

:::standardform
-   You are a full-time student who works long hours.
-   You shouldn't get a dog.
:::

Clearly the argument also has an implicit premise, so a more complete
reconstruction might look like this:

:::standardform
-   You are a full-time student who works long hours.
-   A full-time student who works long hours will not have the time to take proper care of a dog.
-   You shouldn't get a dog unless you can take proper care of it.
-   You shouldn't get a dog.
:::

:::

There are several words and phrases in English that can be used to mark
premises, like 'because'. Here is a list of some of them:

[Premise Markers]{.vocab}
:    'since', 'because', 'for', 'given that', 'in light of', 'seeing as', ...

And there are several words and phrases that can be used to mark a conclusion,
like 'so'. Here is a list of some of them:

[Conclusion Markers]{.vocab}
:   'therefore', 'hence', 'thus', 'so', 'and so it follows that', ...

But it is important to realize that these words are *not always* used in this way.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
16 What about: "My head hurts, because I drank too much last night."
| This is an argument.
| 'My head hurts' is a premise of this argument.
| 'I drank too much last night' is a premise of this argument.
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="16"}
This is *not* an argument. Here, 'because' is used to indicate the *cause* of
the headache, not to indicate a *reason* meant to support a conclusion.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
17 What about: "You should not become an elementary school teacher, seeing as you don't like little kids."
| *This is an argument.
| 'You should not become an elementary school teacher' is a premise.
| *'You should not become an elementary school teacher' is the conclusion.
| *'You don't like little kids' is a premise.
| 'You don't like little kids' is the conclusion.
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
18 Rewrite the argument in standard form.
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10} 
19 Here is a puzzling argument: "Everyone who says they are a donkey says they are an animal. Everyone who says they are an animal speaks the truth. Therefore everyone who says they are a donkey speaks the truth."
| *'Everyone who says they are a donkey says they are an animal' is a premise.
| 'Everyone who says they are a donkey says they are an animal' is the conclusion.
| *'Everyone who says they are an animal speaks the truth' is a premise.
| 'Everyone who says they are an animal speaks the truth' is the conclusion.
| 'Everyone who says they are a donkey speaks the truth' is a premise.
| *'Everyone who says they are a donkey speaks the truth' is the conclusion.
```

English is lazy. We don't mark *each* part of an argument. We mark one or two
parts, and leave it to the reader to figure out the rest.

English is also flexible. The *order* in which different claims are made is no
guide, by itself, to which claims are the premises and which is the
conclusion. The conclusion can come first, followed by the premises. Or the
premises can come first, followed by the conclusion. Or the conclusion can
come in the middle, surrounded by premises.

premise:

-   Without God, morality would not be objective.
-   God exists.

## Evaluating Arguments

An argument is *an attempt* to provide a reason in support of a conclusion.
But not all arguments succeed: sometimes, the reason does not support the
conclusion. 

Consider the following argument:

:::standardform
-   It is raining.
-   When it rains, everyone outside without an umbrella gets wet.
-   You should take an umbrella when you go out. 
:::

This is a pretty good argument. What I mean by that is that, *if the premises
were both true*, they would provide a pretty good reason for thinking that the
conclusion is also true.

I say "pretty good", because the reasoning is not airtight. To see this,
compare the argument above to the following argument:

:::standardform
-   It is raining.
-   When it rains, everyone outside without an umbrella gets wet.
-   If you go outside without an umbrella, you will get wet. 
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
26  Can you explain why the second argument is "airtight" in a way that the first is not? (Hint: imagine that you sometimes enjoy a refreshing walk in the rain.)
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="26"}
Again, there are many good answers to this question. Here is one way to
explain it: suppose you *like getting wet*. Then the premises, if true, don't
support the conclusion that you *should* take an umbrella. But they do support the conclusion that, if you go outside without an umbrella, you will get wet. So for
the first argument, it is *possible that the conclusion is false even though
the premises are true*. But for the second argument, this is *impossible*.
That means the second argument is better, because the premises offer a
stronger *guarantee* of the truth of the conclusion.
:::


```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
27 For the first argument, can you describe a situation in which the two premises of the first argument would be true---it really is raining hard, and there is no other protection from the rain---but the conclusion is false---you should not take an umbrella when you go out?
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=27}
There are many such situations! Maybe you like getting wet. Or maybe you don't like getting wet, but you have some other overriding reason not to take an umbrella: you want to test your new raincoat; you have to carry something with both hands; a serial killer has been targeting umbrella carriers in your neighborhood, etc...
:::

Here is an argument that is not very good at all:

:::standardform
-   If you want a pet, you should get a cat or a dog.
-   You like cats.
-   You shouldn't get a dog.
:::

Even if those two premises were both actually true, they wouldn't give you much of a reason to accept the conclusion. Do you see why?

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
28   Can you explain why this argument is bad? That is, can you explain why, even if those premises are in fact true, they don't give you a reason not to get a dog?
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=28}
There are many good answers. Here one way to explain it: the fact that you like cats gives you a reason to get a cat. But you might also like dogs, so it doesn't give you any reason to get a cat *rather than* a dog, and so doesn't give you a reason not to get a dog.

## Strength and Validity

The [strength]{.vocab} of an argument---would the premises, if they were true,
would support the conclusion?---is something that comes in degrees.
Some arguments are bad---they have little or not strength at all; some are pretty good---they have a high degree of strength; others are "airtight"---their strength is absolute.

When the strength of an argument is absolute, we say it is [valid]{.vocab}:

Validity
:   [An argument is [valid]{.vocab} if and only if it is impossible for all
    the premises to be true but the conclusion false.]{.def}

That is, for an argument to be valid, it must be *absolutely impossible* for the conclusion to be false
in any situation where the premises are true. Here is an example of a valid argument:

::: standardform
1.  Oranges are either fruits or musical instruments.
2.  Oranges are not fruits.
3.  Oranges are musical instruments.
:::

If we grant that the two premises are true, we *must* also grant that the
conclusion is true. The premises don't leave any room for the conclusion to be
false.

Here is an example of an argument that is strong but not valid:

:::standardform
-   You are reading this book.
-   This is a logic book, assigned for a logic class.
-   You are a logic student.
:::

The premises, if true, support the conclusion: if you are reading this book,
which has been assigned for a logic class, it is quite likely that you are
indeed a logic student. But that support is not *absolute*. It is *possible*
that you, the reader of this logic book, which has indeed been assigned for a
logic class, are not a logic student. You might be the friend of a logic
student or a logic professor. Or you might have stumbled onto this book for
some other reason.

```

## Soundness and Validity

In real life, we do not just care about the strength of an argument. We also
care about whether or not the premises are actually true. For example, this
argument is valid, and so has the highest possible degree of strength, but the
second premise, (2), is false. So this argument does not in fact give us any
reason to believe that oranges are musical instruments:

::: standardform
1.  Oranges are either fruits or musical instruments.
2.  Oranges are not fruits.
3.  Oranges are musical instruments.
:::


By contrast, this argument is valid *and* its premises are actually true:

::: standardform
1.  Oranges are either fruits or vegetables.
2.  Oranges are not vegetables.
3.  Oranges are fruits.
:::

When an argument is **both* valid **and** all of its premises are true, we say it is [sound]{.vocab}:

Soundness
:   An argument is [sound]{.vocab} if and only if it is valid and all of its premises are true.

The first argument we considered against majoring in philosophy is valid, but it is not sound:

:::standardform
1.  A major in philosophy won't get you a good job. 
2.  You should choose a major that will get you a good job. 
3.  You shouldn't major in philosophy.
:::

It is valid because if both premises *were* true, the conclusion would *have
to be* true as well. But it isn't sound because premise (1) is false. Premise
(2) might also be false---that is controversial. But one false premise is
enough: since that premise is in fact false, this argument gives us no reason
to believe that its conclusion is in fact true.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
32 <div class="standardform"> <ol type="1"> <li>Socrates is a man.</li> <li>All men are carrots.</li> <li>Socrates is a carrot.</li> </ol> </div><p>This argument is:</p>
| sound
| *valid
| *strong
| weak
```

::: {.reaction .incorrect ex="32"}
To be sound, the argument has to be **both** valid **and** all the premises have to be true.
In this case, both premises are obviously false. So the argument is not sound. 

Is it valid? Yes! If those premises *were* both true, then the conclusion
would **have to be** true as well. There is **no possible situation** in which
the premises are true and the conclusion is false. So it is valid.

Validity is the highest degree of strength. So, since it is valid, it is also strong.

And weakness is the opposite of strength. So, since it is strong, it is not weak.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
33 <div class="standardform"> <ol type="1"> <li>Socrates is human.</li> <li>All humans are mortal.</li> <li>Socrates is mortal.</li> </ol> </div> <p>This argument is</p>:
| *sound
| *valid
| *strong
| weak
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=33}
To be sound, the argument has to be **both** valid **and** all the premises have to be true.
In this case, both premises are actually true. So whether or not the argument is sound depends
on whether or not it is valid.

Is it valid? Yes! Those premises, if true, leave no room for the conclusion to
be false. There is not even the slimmest logical possibility that Socrates be
human and all humans be mortal, but Socrates not be mortal.

So, since the argument is valid and all of its premises are true, it is also sound.

And since it is valid, and validity is the highest degree of strength, it is also strong.

And since it is strong, it is not weak.

| sound
| valid
| strong
| *weak
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=34}
To be sound, the argument has to be **both** valid **and** all the premises have to be true. In this case,
both premises are true. So whether or not it is sound depends on whether or not it is valid.

Is it valid? No! We can easily imagine situations in which both premises are true but the conclusion is false. Suppose Socrates were a mortal mouse, or a mortal cow, or a mortal golden retriever.

Since it is not valid, it is not sound, even though all of its premises are true.

On reflection, it isn't even strong: those premises, if true, do not offer much support at all for the conclusion. So the argument is weak.

Notice that the arguments in (35) and (36) have the same logical form:

-   If $P$, then $Q$
-   $Q$
:::

Can you see how, given what 'if' and 'then' mean, any argument with this form must be valid?

Notice that the argument in (37) has a *different* logical form than the argument in (35) and (36):

::: standardform
-   $Q$
-   If $P$, then $Q$
-   $P$
:::

Can you see why arguments with this form might not be valid? If $P$ is true,
then $Q$ is true. So the truth of $P$ entails the truth of $Q$. But the truth
of $Q$ doesn't entail the truth of $P$: there might be some other reason why
$Q$ is true.

:::{.reaction .correct ex=38}
This is a **weird** case.

It is clear that the argument is not sound: the first premise is true, but the
second premise is false. In fact, it is clear that the argument **cannot
ever** be sound: whenever the first premise is true, the second is false, and
vice versa. So there is no possible situation in which both of those premises
are true.

But the argument is valid. It is valid for the same reason it can never be
sound: those two premises can never both be true together. So that means that
it is impossible for the premises to both be true, and the conclusion false.
But in this case, the impossibility has nothing to do with the *relation*
between the premises and the conclusion. It lies entirely on the side of the
premises.

| *sound
| *valid
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=39}
This is another **weird** case.

The premise is true. So whether or not it is sound depends on whether or not it is valid.

Is it valid? Yes, because it is impossible that its premises be true but its
conclusion false. As above, the impossibility is one-sided. The issue is that
the conclusion is a logically necessary truth: it cannot possibily be false.
This has nothing to do with the *relation* between the premise and conclusion,
but it is enough to satisify the definition of validity. 

So, since the argument is valid, and its premise is true, it is also sound.

## Supplement

This chapter has a [supplement](01S). This is an optional extra bit of reading
and exercises, for anyone who feels that more practice would be helpful.

Also, above, I said that we would return to the example of Sarah's argument from the Labryinth at the end of this chapter.
That was a bit of a fib. For additional discussion, also see the supplement.
