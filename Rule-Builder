# Derived Rule Builders

This is not an assignment, and it is not worth any points or credit.

A "Rule Builder" is a playground with a "save" button. The "save" button lets
you save the argument you have derived as a derived rule, which you can use in
other derivations.

## Your Derived Rules

Here are the rules you have successfully enabled:

:::{.derived-rules .boxed .liveshapes}
:::

## SL Rule Builder

```{.Playground .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=saveRule}
```

## PL Rule Builder

```{.Playground .FirstOrder options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=saveRule}
```
