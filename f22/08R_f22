## Introduction

We return to the project we began in [Chapter 3](03R):
 translating between English and SL. 
The specific learning objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can use commas to disambiguate structurally complex sentences, and
    guide my symbolization of those sentences
b.  I can symbolize sentences with compound subjects and predicates
c.  I can symbolize sentences involving restricted quantifier phrases
    using disjunctions and conjunctions

# [Friedrich
Nietzsche](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"} <!-_-->

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844&ndash;1900) was a German philosopher and
cultural critic who published intensively in the 1870s and 1880s. He
is famous for uncompromising criticisms of traditional European
morality and religion, as well as of conventional philosophical ideas
and social and political pieties associated with modernity. Many of
these criticisms rely on psychological diagnoses that expose false
consciousness infecting people&rsquo;s received ideas; for that
reason, he is often associated with a group of late modern thinkers
(including Marx and Freud) who advanced a &ldquo;hermeneutics of
suspicion&rdquo; against traditional values (see Foucault [1964] 1990,
Ricoeur [1965] 1970, Leiter 2004). Nietzsche also used his
psychological analyses to support original theories about the nature
of the self and provocative proposals suggesting new values that he
thought would promote cultural renewal and improve social and
psychological life by comparison to life under the traditional values
he criticized.</p>
</div>
:::

Nietzsche complains that "the origin of language did not happen logically",
 and describes language as an unwieldy pile of metaphor, poetry, rhetoric:

> A mobile army of metaphors,
> [metonyms](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metonymy){target="_blank"
> rel="noopener noreferrer"}, anthropomorphisms, in short a totality of human
> relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified,
> transferred, and decorated, and which after long use people think are fixed,
> canonical, and binding. ("On Truth and Lie in an Extra-moral Sense"
> [p. 6](https://archive.org/details/NietzscheOnTruthAndLie){target="_blank"
> rel="noopener noreferrer"}). <!--_-->

It is enough to make some throw up their hands,
 and declare natural languages, like English, unfit for serious work.

But that's a bit much. We can, with work, tease out the underlying logical form of
the information expressed by English sentences. And we can display that form
in our artificial language, SL.
Whatever you may think of SL,
 it is emphatically *not* a creature of metaphor or metonym;
 it is a language *devoid* of poetry;
 it is rhetorically *limp*.
And, for course, *it is logical* in its origin,
 designed to display logical form in a way that is free from all ambiguity.

## Review

We covered the basic building blocks of translation between English and SL in
[Unit 3](03R). Let's quickly review some things covered there. 

First, conditionals:

-   'if' is an antecedent marker, that can work alone, or with the help of
    'then'.
-   'then' is an optional helper word that coordinates with 'if', and marks a
    consequent. 
-   'only if' is a consequent marker.
-   Stylistic variants of 'if' include 'provided that', 'on the condition
    that', 'given that', and so on.

This means that the following sentences are all equivalent, and should all be
translated as 'P → Q':

:::example
-   if P then Q
-   if P, Q
-   Q if P
-   P only if Q
-   only if Q, P
:::

And, replacing 'if' with some stylistic variants, these are also all
translated as 'P → Q':

:::example
-   given that P, Q
-   Q provided that P
-   P only on the condition that Q
:::

Second, biconditionals:

-   'if and only if' expresses the biconditional.
-   Stylistic variants of 'if and only if' include 'just in case' and 'exactly
    on the condition that'.

So these are all ways of saying 'P ↔ Q':

:::example
-   P if and only if Q
-   P just in case Q
-   P exactly on the condition that Q
:::

Third, conjunctions:

-   'both' is an optional helper word that coordinates with 'and'.
-   Stylistic variants of 'and' include 'but', 'however', 'nevertheless', and
    so on.

So these are all ways of saying 'P ∧ Q':

:::example
-   both P and Q
-   P and Q
-   P but Q
-   P, however Q
:::

Fourth, disjunctions:

-   'either' is an optional helper word that coordinates with 'or'.
-   'unless' is a stylistic variant of 'or'.

So these are all ways of saying 'P ∨ Q':

:::example
-   either P or Q
-   P or Q
-   P unless Q
:::

Fifth, negations:

-    'not', in English, stays local: it negates the smallest sentence it is
     part of. It doesn't spread negativity to other parts of the sentence.
-    English *prefers*, where possible, to express negation by putting 'not'
     next to the main verb:
     -    'It is not raining' is preferred to 'It is not the case that it is
          raining'
-    That is not possible when negating a molecular sentence, which does not
     have a main verb (the main syntactic element is instead the main connective).
     -    To negate a molecular sentence, we use the prefix 'it is not the case
     that' 
     -    'It is not the case that (both it is raining and it is snowing).'
     -    We have to be careful, using helper words or parentheses, to make
          sure that we are negating the entire molecular sentence, and not
          just one of its parts.

So, these are both ways of saying '¬P', where 'P' is 'Petunias are pretty':

:::example
-   It is not the case that petunias are pretty.
-   Petunias are not pretty.
:::

And it is important to distinguish sentences like these:

:::example
-   ¬P → Q: if not P then Q
-   ¬(P → Q): not (if P then Q)
:::

And these:

:::example
-   ¬P ∧ Q: both not P and Q
-   ¬(P ∧ Q): not both P and Q
:::

And these:

:::example
-   ¬P ∨ Q: either not P or Q
-   ¬(P ∨ Q): not either P or Q
:::

That last one bumps up against another thing we learned:

-    'Neither P nor Q' can be rendered either as 'Not either P or Q' or 'Both
     not P and not Q'.

We also discussed the way that sentences with more than one connective can be
structurally ambiguous, and how carefully choice of word order allows us to
avoid this.

## Ambiguity in Sentences involving 'if' and 'not'

Ambiguity is the
[bugbear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugbear){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"} of the logician! If only natural languages were as
clean and precise as our artificial language! <!--_-->

We start by reviewing some potential ambiguities involving the interaction of
negations and conditionals.

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| W: You watch the pot
| P: The pot will boil
:::

This sentence has two readings:

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that the pot will boil if you watch it.
:::

'It is not the case that' works as a prefix: it negates the sentence that
comes after it. But in this case,
there are two sentences it might be negating. It might be negating 'the pot
will boil':

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that [the pot will boil]{.wavy} if you watch it.
| ¬P if W
| W → ¬P
:::

Or it might be negating the entire conditional, 'the pot will boil if you
watch it':

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that [the pot will boil if you watch it]{.wavy}.
| ¬(P if W) 
| ¬(W → P)
:::

The first reading expresses an instance of the old adage: *a
watched pot never boils*. The second reading denies you the
superpower of boiling water just by watching it. 
The original English can be read either way.

We can augment English with parentheses in order to disambiguate:

::: {.transl}
| (It is not the case that the pot will boil) if you watch it.
| It is not the case that (the pot will boil if you watch it).
:::

Or we can find ways to express what we mean in English that are not ambiguous.

::: {.transl}
| If you watch the pot, then it is not the case that the pot will boil.
| W → ¬P
| It is not the case that if you watch the pot, then the pot will boil.
| ¬(W → P)
:::

Note how in that last example, 'it is not the case that' can *only* negate the
entire conditional:

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that [if you watch the pot, then the pot will boil]{.wavy}.
:::

The position of the 'if' blocks it from negating just 'you watch the pot':

::: {.transl}
| [It is not the case that]{.wavy} if [you watch the pot]{.wavy}, then the pot will boil.
:::

See how the 'if' gets in the way? That negation cannot "leap over" the 'if' to
negate 'you watch the pot'. And it cannot negate 'if you watch the pot',
because that isn't a complete sentence. The only *complete sentence* properly
positions for it to negate is the entire conditional.

If you *want* the negation to attach to 'the pot will boil', the easiest way
to achieve that, without any ambiguity, is to put the 'not' next to verb:

::: {.transl}
| The pot will not boil if you watch it.
| W → ¬P
:::

## Ambiguities Involving Nested Conditionals

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| P: You are a Packers fan
| R: You hate the Bears
| W: You grew up in Wisconsin
:::

This sentence is structurally ambiguous:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears.
:::

This sentence contains two 'if's.  An 'if' is an antecedent marker. So this
sentence contains two antecedents. That means it contains two conditionals,
and only one of those two conditionals is the main connective. Which is it?

Focus just on the first 'if'. It marks a sentence as an antecedent. But which
sentence does it mark? Here is one possibility:

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan]{.wavy} if you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears
| If P then (if W R)
| P → (W → R)
:::

Here is the other possibility:

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin]{.wavy} you hate the Bears
| If (P if W) then R
| (W -> P) → R
:::

How can we express these two readings unambiguously in English?
One option is to use Canonical English:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan, then (if you grew up in Wisconsin, then you hate
  the Bears)
| If you are a Packers fan, then if you grew up in Wisconsin, then you hate
  the Bears
| P → (W → R)

| If (if you grew up in Wisconsin, then you are a Packers fan), then you hate
  the Bears
| If if you grew up in Wisconsin, then you are a Packers fan, then you hate
  the Bears
| (W -> P) → R
:::

Notice how, even without the parentheses, these sentences avoid ambiguity, by
strategy placement of 'if's and 'then's.

We don't need to go full Canonical to avoid ambiguity. The following is not
ambiguous:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan *then* if you grew up in Wisconsin you
  hate the Bears.
:::

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan]{.wavy} *then* if you grew up in Wisconsin you
  hate the Bears.
| P → (W → R)
:::

But the 'then' blocks the other reading: 

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan]{.wavy} *then* [if you grew up in Wisconsin]{.wavy} you
  hate the Bears.
:::

See how the 'then' breaks up the party, and keeps the first 'if' from marking
'you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin'?

On the other hand, this sentence remains ambiguous, even with the addition of
the 'then':

::: transl
| If you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin *then* you
  hate the Bears.
| If [you are a Packers fan]{.wavy} if you grew up in Wisconsin *then* you
  hate the Bears.
| If [you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin]{.wavy} *then* you
  hate the Bears.
:::

Both of our readings treat R: 'You hate the Bears' as *a* consequent, so
marking it explicitly as a consequent with 'then' doesn't help decide between
them.

Another tool we can use to disambiguate is a comma. Consider: 

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan, if you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears.
| P → (W → R)

| If you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin, you hate the Bears.
| (W -> P) → R
:::

Do you see how the comma directs you to one reading over the other?
It would be too strong to say that the comma *forces* one reading over the
other, but it clearly *suggests* one reading over the other.
There is no hard and fast rule in English about the use of commas to indicate
logical structure. But now that you are aware of this problem, *you should
always use commas in this way when you can.* It will make you a better writer.

:::

Even if there is no hard and fast rule in English about the use of commas,
 in the class, we will idealize English a little bit, and pretend that this
 is a hard and fast rule:

The Comma Rule
:   When a sentence would otherwise be ambiguous, a comma indicates a bigger
    structural break.

Here is a short video lecture, going over the Comma Rule:

## Ambiguity in Sentences Involving 'And', 'Or', and 'If and Only If'

The comma rule is also helpful for resolving ambiguities in sentences
involving our other connectives too. For example, this sentence is ambiguous:

::: {.transl}
| People talk and rumors spread unless questions are asked.
:::

The two readings, disambiguated with commas, are:

::: transl
| People talk and rumors spread, unless questions are asked.
| (P∧R) ∨ Q
| People talk, and rumors spread unless questions are asked.
| P ∧ (R∨Q)
:::

Do you see that these two sentences mean very different things, and how the
commas help disambiguate?

Again, this is ambiguous:

::: {.transl}
| She wins the prize if and only if she eats the most hot peppers and she has
  a high tolerance for spicy food.
:::

The two readings, disambiguated with commas, are:

::: {.transl}
| She wins the prize, if and only if she eats the most hot peppers and she has
  a high tolerance for spicy food.
| P ↔ (Q∧S)
| She wins the prize if and only if she eats the most hot peppers, and she has
  a high tolerance for spicy food.
| (P↔Q) ∧ S
:::

Only the second reading tells us that she has a high tolerance for spicy food,
full stop, and so gives us a reason to put our money on her to win the prize.
Paying careful attention to commas can save you money when gambling on eating
contests at bars.

:::illustration

:::


## Compound Subjects and Predicates

Here is a short video lecture covering the material from this section:

::: solution
::: youtube
<https://youtu.be/EnqdZMmdgLc>
:::
:::

These two sentences are logically equivalent in English:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree talked to the press and Malik talked to the press.
| Desiree and Malik talked to the press.
:::

English craves brevity. 
So, instead of applying the *same predicate* ('talked to
the press') twice ('Desiree talked to the press' and 'Malik talked to the
press') and then conjoining those two sentences into a conjunction, we conjoin
the two subjects into a compound subject ('Desiree and Malik'), and apply the
predicate once ('Desiree and Malik talked to the press').

We do the same sort of thing when we want to apply two predicates to the same
subject:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree is imposing and Desiree is tall.
| Desiree is imposing and tall.
:::

But there is a trap.
Consider what happens here:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree is in love and Malik is in love.
| Desiree and Malik are in love.
:::

'Desiree and Malik are in love' is ambigious.
On one reading, it is a simple conjunction: 'Desiree is in love and Malik is
in love'. But on the most natural reading, it means that they are *in love
with each other*. That is not a simple conjunction.

Or consider:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree and Malik are two people.
| Desiree is two people and Malik is two people.
:::

The first sentence is true: it says that, taken together, Desiree and Malik
are two.
The second is false: it says that each separately is two people.

:::aside
:::youtube
https://youtu.be/iMV8btPW4wU
:::

I suppose the second sentence *could* be true. Perhaps each of them is really
just two kids stacked in a trenchcoat.
:::

## Compound Subjects, Predicates, and Ambiguity

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| P: The alarm went off
| Q: Desiree is awake
| R: Malik is awake
:::

Compound subjects and predicates are nice for brevity.
But they also serve a useful *logical* purpose.
Consider:

::: {.transl}
| [Desiree and Malik are awake]{.wrap} if the alarm went off.
| P → (Q∧R)
:::

The use of the compound subject forces this reading.
You cannot read the sentence instead as:

There is no temptation to read this as:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree is awake and (Malik is awake if the alarm went off).
| Q ∧ (P→R)
:::

Note how, in order to make the conjunction the main connective,
 we had to break up the compound subject, 'Desiree and Malik',
 and instead predicate awakefulness to each separately.

This is because, in English, compound subjects and predicates "group more
tightly" than ordinary sentential connectives.

## Quantification

:::solution
::: youtube
<https://youtu.be/yDdGXYIAt4A>
:::
:::

English has several *quantificational idioms*. 
These are words like 'all', 'some', and 'none'. 
In later chapters, we will introduce *quantifiers*, 
 which are formal tools specially designed to capture the logic of these idioms.
Here we consider what we can do to capture some quantificational idioms using the tools we already have.

:::soawrapper
::: soasticky
| R: Ruth liked the movie
| S: Sonia liked the movie
| T: Clarence liked the movie

We are Ruth, Sonia, and Clarence.
:::

Suppose there are exactly three of us: Ruth, Sonia, and Clarence.
We all go to a movie, and we all liked it:

::: {.transl}
| All of us liked the movie.
:::

We can translate this into SL. 
The trick is to see that, since we are Ruth, Sonia, and Clarence, the claim
that *all of us* liked the movie can be expressed as a conjunction:

::: {.transl}
| All of us liked the movie.
| Ruth liked the movie and Sonia liked the movie and Clarence liked the movie.
| R ∧ S ∧ T
:::

Or suppose we didn't all like it:

::: transl
| Not all of us liked the movie.
| It is not the cas that (Ruth liked the movie and Sonia liked the movie and Clarence liked the movie)
| ¬(R∧S∧T)
:::

Do you see how 'not all of us' is just the negation of 'all of us'?

What if we all *didn't* like the movie?

::: transl
| All of us did not like the movie.
| Ruth and Sonia and Clarence didn't like the movie.
| Ruth didn't like the movie and Sonia didn't like the movie and Clarence didn't like the movie.
| ¬R ∧ ¬S ∧ ¬T
:::

Note the difference between saying that *not all of us* like it, and *all of
us did not* like it.
These are very different claims: maybe *not all of us* liked it, but *some of
us* did:

::: transl
| Some of us liked the movie.
| Ruth liked the movie or Sonia liked the movie or Clarence liked the movie.
| R ∨ S ∨ T
:::

Here, we treat 'some of us' as meaning 'at least one of us'.
Perhaps in English 'some of us' means 'at least *two* of us'.
We are going to ignore that wrinkle, and treat 'some' as meaning 'at least
one'.

Suppose none of us liked the movie:

::: transl
| None of us liked the movie.
:::

There are two ways to approach this. First, note that this is logically
equivalent to 'All of us did not like the movie', which we've already seen
above:

::: transl
| None of us liked the movie.
| All of us did not like the movie.
| Ruth didn't like the movie and Sonia didn't like the movie and Clarence didn't like the movie.
| ¬R ∧ ¬S ∧ ¬T
:::

Or, second, note that that 'none of us' is also equivalent to 'not some of
us':

::: transl
| None of us liked the movie.
| It is not the case that some of us liked the movie.
| It is not the case that (Ruth liked the movie or Sonia liked the movie or Clarence liked the movie).
| ¬(R ∨ S ∨ T)
:::

Finally, note that these two ways of treating 'none of us' mirror our two ways
of treating 'neither...nor...':


::: transl
| Neither Ruth nor Clarence liked the movie
| ¬R ∧ ¬T
| ¬(R ∨ T)
:::

'None of' is a kind of generalized form of 'Neither...nor...'.

:::

## Some but not All

Our translation of 'some of us' using an inclusive disjunction raises two
issues.

First, as already mentioned, you may think that 'some' implies *more than
one*. But the inclusive disjunction is true if at least one of its disjuncts
is true. So our translation doesn't capture this implication.

Second, in many situations, 'some' appears to imply 'not all'. But the
inclusive disjunction is true if all of its disjuncts are true. So our
translation doesn't capture this implication either.

Here is an example in which 'some' appears to imply 'not all':

> A: "Did any of your friends show up to your birthday party?"
>
> B: "Some of them did." 
> 
> A: "Oh! Good! How many?" 
>
> B: "Well, actually, all of them did."

B's response is misleading. Why did she say 'some' when she could have said
'all'? Was her first answer *false*?

On the other hand, consider:

> A: "How did you do on the test?"
>
> B: "I've only checked my scores on the first two questions. I got those
> correct. So I know that I got some of the questions correct."

Here B's use of 'some' clearly does not imply 'not all'. At most, it implies
that she is not in a position to *know* whether or not she got all the answers
correct.

In the 1970s, Paul Grice, a philosopher of language, provided a compelling
account of what is going on in cases like this, as part of his theory
of "Conversational Implicature". Grice thinks that in conversation, we expect
folks to be cooperative, and this means we expect them to follow a few basic
"maxims" or rules. 

One of these maxims is:

Maxim of Quantity
:   Be as informative as required.

When B *knows* that *all* her friends came to the party, but says, "Some of my
friends came to the party," she violates this maxim. What she says isn't
*false*; but it is *misleading, because we expected her to be more
informative.

On the other hand, when B said, "I got some of the problems correct," she was in no position to know whether or not she got all of them
correct, so this was as informative as she could be. In that context, her use
of 'some' instead of 'all' is not misleading, and our sense that 'some'
implies 'not all' disappears.

That's a neat bit of theory about how language works.
We will continue to assume that 'some' means 'at
least one',
 and can be translated adequately using an inclusive disjunction.
