## Course Description

This is a class in formal logic. *Logic* is the study of reasoning, and what
makes good reasoning good and bad reasoning bad. *Formal* logic studies
reasoning by studying the various *structures* or *forms* that different
pieces of reasoning, good and bad, might take.

Formal logic is also called *symbolic* logic, because we study logical form
not in English, but in an artificial language composed of letters and
unfamiliar symbols, in much the same way that mathematicians study facts about
numbers not in English, but in the artificial language of Algebra. So this
class will in many ways be very much like a math class. It's just that the
object of our study is not *reasoning about numbers*, as in Algebra, but
*reasoning in general*. 

Reasoning is a form of *information processing*. When we study logical form,
we are studying the form of reasoning, but also, we are studying the form of
*information*. Since we use *language* to express our reasoning, we are also
studying the way language encodes and expresses information. So, in studying
formal logic, you are studying an important part of the foundations of
mathematics, linguistics, cognitive science, and computer science---all
disciplines that deal, in different ways, with the processing of information.

This isn't just a syllabus; it's also your first assignment!
That means it contains questions. To get credit for this assignment, you must
answer *all* of the questions. Some questions are multiple choice:

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
1 To get credit for this assignment, I must
|*answer all the questions.
|answer most of questions. 
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=1}
Hmm. That's not right. Are you just randomly clicking answers without reading
first? Try again.

:::{.reaction .correct ex=1}
Great! You've correctly answered your first reading question! Notice the
progress bar across the top of the page, which helps you keep track of your progress.

Some questions are multiple choice, where you need to select *all* correct
answers. These have checkboxes next to each possible answer, instead of radio
buttons:

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
2 Logic is foundational for
| *mathematics
| *linguistics
| *cognitive science
| *computer science
```

And some questions are open-ended short answer questions. To get credit for an
open-ended question, you need to submit something, but the content of your
response will not be graded:

:::

## The "Flipped" and "Hybrid" Classroom

This class is "flipped". I will not lecture in class. I expect you to work
through the reading and exercises, and bring your questions and confusions to class, where
we can work them together.
I am *not* expecting you to figure everything on your own, without my help.
But I am expecting you first to *try* things out on your own, and, when
confused, to seek out my help.

[Research suggests](https://www.pnas.org/node/889733) 
that students *feel like they learn more* from a good lecture,
but actually learn less. My goal for you in this class is that you learn more,
not that you feel like you learn more.

I expect you to spend a significant amount of time working on this course
*outside of class meetings*. [This is a 3 credit hour course, so the average student
should expect to spend approximately 9 hours a week on this
course](https://policy.illinoisstate.edu/academic/4-1-19.shtml).
This is a "hybrid" class, so we will spend 2 hours a week in person, instead of the
usual 3 hour. I expect you to use that extra hour work asynchronously through
the course material.

Class time is essential. It is the time I am most easily available to help. It
is the time when you can ask for additional explanations, or demonstrations,
or for a mini-lecture on some issue that you find confusing.
Sometimes I will offer structured activities in class, but
often, I will not: it will be up to you to set the agenda, by letting me know
what you are working on, and how I can help.

I often have students who will arrive in class not having done the reading,
and not having attempted any of the exercises. So they end up spending class
time do the reading. This is a poor use of class time. I cannot help you read,
and I will not provide a lecture that enables you to avoid the reading.

You may find yourself stuck and frustrated, and so be tempted to skip class.
But that's the opposite of what you need to do. If you are stuck and
frustrated, class is where you come for support, understanding, and help.
Don't isolate yourself, and cut yourself off from the very thing you need to
succeed!

:::{.no-print}
```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
4 This course won't have lectures because (select all correct answers):
| the professor is lazy and doesn't want to teach
| the professor thinks the material is easy and everyone should be able to understand it without his help
| the professor doesn't know how to lecture
| *the professor believes that lecturing is not the most effective way to actually teach logic
5 If I find myself confused, frustrated, and discouraged in this class (select all correct answers):
| I should probably just give up because I am not smart enough to learn logic
| I should be embarrased because I am not studenting correctly
| *I should come to class and ask for help
| I should isolate myself in a cocoon of despair
```
:::

## Assignment Structure

This class uses a *Mastery Grading Scheme*. In a traditional grading scheme, you
march through all the material at a set pace, whether you understand it or
not. In a Mastery Grading Scheme, the pace is flexible, and your grade is based
upon how many units you *complete* by the end of the term.

You may recognize this idea from video games, where you often have to work
through several levels, each introducing new challenges, in order to complete
the game.

The class is divided into 17 units of content, and two "collaboration"
units.
Each unit of content is divided into three parts:

-   **Reading**
-   **Exercises**
-   A **Mastery check**

To *complete* a unit, you must *complete* each of these three parts.
If you do exceptionally well on the mastery check, we say that you have not
just *completed* the unit, but *mastered* it. Your grade for the course is
based upon how many units you complete and how many you master, according to
the following table:

   Course Grade                        Requirement
  -------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        A         at least <del>16</del> <ins>15</ins> units completed, at least 10 of which are also mastered
        B         at least <del>14</del> <ins>13</ins> units completed, at least 8 of which are also mastered
        C         at least <del>12</del> <ins>10</ins> units completed
        D         at least 8 units completed

:::{.no-print}
```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
6 To complete a unit,
| one must complete the mastery check; everything else is optional
| *one must complete the reading, exercises, and mastery check
| one must attempt the reading, exercises, and mastery check
7 To get an B in this course,
| one must complete 22 units (14 complete + 8 mastered)
| *one must complete 14 units (and at least 8 of those 14 must also be mastered)
| one must score a B or higher on the final exam
8 True or false: this course has a final exam
| True
| *False
9 If I complete the reading and exercises for lots of units, but never pass any of the mastery checks
| my grade in the course will probably be a C or a D, since I did a lot of work
| *my grade in the course will be an F, even though I did a lot of work
| my grade in the course will depend on how many total points I earned on the readings and exercises
```
:::

## Completing and Mastering

To [complete]{.vocab} a unit, you must complete all three parts: reading,
exercises, and mastery check. Each part is different, and has a different standard for what
counts as "complete". Here is the standard for "completing" a unit:

-   Reading = 100%
-   Exercises ≥ 80%
-   Mastery check ≥ 60% 

As mentioned above, if you do especially well on the mastery check, we say
that you have not just completed the unit, but [mastered]{.vocab} it. The standard for
"especially well" is scoring at least 80%. So here is the standard for
"mastering" a unit:

-   Reading = 100%
-   Exercises ≥ 80%
-   Mastery check ≥ 80%

## Reading

Each reading assignment contains several questions scattered throughout.
These questions are meant to get you to stop and think about what you've just
read. If you just jump from question to question, and skip the actual reading,
you are doing it wrong, and you struggle to understand the material.

By design, you can never successfully submit an incorrect answer to a reading
question. If you try, you will be told that your answer is incorrect and asked
to try again. In some cases (e.g., multiple choice questions), this is
trivial: keep trying to submit until you find the correct answer, and your
submission is accepted. In all other cases, it is not trivial. In all such
cases, the solutions will be provided in the text. But in all cases, you
should try to figure it out for yourself before looking at the provided
solutions.

To complete the Reading, you need to answer *all* of the reading questions,
earning a score of 100%.

## Exercises

Exercises contain more questions, based on what you learned in the reading. As
with the reading questions, it is not possible to submit wrong answers: if you
try, you will be told that your answer is incorrect and asked to try again.
But solutions are not provided: your job is to figure out how to solve these
problems yourself, and sometimes that can be quite challenging.

To complete the Exercises, you need to score at least 80%.

## Mastery Checks

Mastery Checks are short low-stakes open-book timed exams that you complete
online, on your own time.

you are **not allowed to collaborate** on mastery checks. A mastery check is
something you do on your own, to prove, both to me and to yourself, that you
understand the material from this chapter.

The questions are the same in kind as those in the exercises. But on a mastery
check, the training wheels have been removed: if you try to submit an
incorrect answer, it will be accepted, and you will earn 0 points on that
question.

A typical Mastery Check will have three questions, and might have a time limit
of 30 minutes. To "complete" the unit, you need to score at least 60%, which
means getting at least 2 out of the 3 questions correct. To "master" the unit,
you need to score at least 80%, which, if there are only 3 questions, means
getting all 3 of those questions correct.

Mastery Checks are **timed**, and each Mastery Check has an access key. You
need to enter the access key to start the assignment. Once the assignment
starts, there is no "pause" button, and you will only get credit for work
submitted before the timer reaches zero.

Mastery Checks are low-stakes because **you can retake them as many times as
needed**. A retakes will have different questions, meant to cover similar
material at a similar level of difficulty. For each numbered problem, your
**highest score** across retakes is what counts. So, when doing a retake, you
only need to worry about the problems you got wrong on previous attempts. So,
if you wish to improve your score, request a retake, by sending me a DM on
GroupMe.

There are two limits on this. First, you are only allowed **two retakes a
week**. I don't mean two retakes *per mastery check*. I mean two retakes
*in total*. So, in a given week, you might retake the mastery check for unit 03
twice, or you might retake the mastery check for unit 01 once and the mastery
check for unit 03 once. This is a substantial constraint. Before you request a
retake, you should figure out what went wrong on your last attempt, and be confident that you can
get it right on this attempt. You don't want to keep making the same mistake,
and burn through all your attempts.

The second limit on retakes is that, for some of the units, the Mastery Checks [expire]{.vocab}. Once a
Mastery Check *expires*, you are only allowed to take it *once* more. So, if
you've already taken it, you are only allowed one retake. And if you've not taken
it at all, you will only be allowed to take it once, without any retakes.
Expiration dates are there to encourage a *bare minimum* pace of progress
through the course material. If you are *just* meeting expiration dates, you
will be on a pace to earn a D in the course.

Information about each Mastery Check, including the time allotted, the access
key, and the expiration date, can all be found in the [Table of
Contents](Book_f22#table-of-contents).

:::{.no-print}
```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
10 To complete a reading assignment,
| *I must answer all the questions correctly
| I must answer most of the questions correctly, but not all
11 To complete an exercises assignment,
| *I must score at least 80%.
| I must score at least 60%.
| I must answer all the questions correctly.
12 I can retake a mastery check
| once, if I request a retake within a week of the due date
| twice, but I only have a week to do so
| *as many times as needed, so long as it has not expired, but I only get to request two retakes a week
13 If I fail a mastery check,
| I should retake it, and hope that I do better
| *I should figure out what went wrong, so I won't make the same mistake again, and then retake it
| I should give up on that unit, and move on to the next
```
:::

## Collaboration Units

The two "collaboration" units are meant to recognize and motivate your
engagement in the class, and your collaboration with your peers. Learning
logic is easier when you are part of a community of logic learners!

Genuine engagement and collaboration are hard to measure. Attempts to quantify
such things often lead to annoyance and insincerity. In my experience, schemes
that attempt to "bean count" participation only motivate folks to do the bare
minimum, and the results of this are underwhelming.

At bare minimum, I want you to come to class, and I want us to come to together into a friendly
and supportive community of folks working on logic and helping each other
learn logic.

To help make that possible, I will award 10 "collaboration points" for each
class meeting you attend. And, for every 110 collaboration points, you earn,
you earn a "collaboration unit". These units are added to your tally of
completed units, and can make the difference between a D to a C, or a C to a
B, or a B to an A.

Collaboration units can only be "completed"; they cannot be "mastered".

I recognize that there are legitimate reasons to miss class. You can miss
several classes, and still earn two collaboration units, which is the maximum
possible. And you can earn an A in this course without completing any
collaboration units, by completing more units of content.

:::{.no-print}
```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
14 Collaboration points are awarded for attendance because (select all correct answers)
| the professor believes that attendance is the same thing as genuine collaboration and engagement
| *the professor believes that attempts to measure genuine collaboration and engagement usually don't work out very well
| *the professor believes wishes to encourage attendance, in hopes of fostering a friendly and supportive community in the classroom, which supports collaboration and engagement
```
:::

## Due Dates and Expectations

Everything in this class has the same due date: Friday, December 16th, at 5pm.
This is the last day of Finals Week, and **I will not accept any work after
that time**. You have been warned.

The whole point of a mastery grading scheme is that,
 if you need more time to complete a unit,
 you should take that time,
 and learn the material,
 rather than rushing on to the next thing.
It is not possible, consistent with this design, to assign traditional due
dates to assignments as we go.

But there are some rules of thumb. I've set the grading scale so that, to
be on track to earn an A, you need to complete one unit a week. Note that some
units might be significantly harder than others, so it would behoove you to
move at a faster pace when you can, so as to give yourself a cushion later on.

And, as mentioned above, some Mastery Checks have [Expiration Dates]{.vocab}.
These correspond to the *minimum rate of progress* needed to earn a D in the
course.

:::{.no-print}
```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
15 The final due date for all submissions is
| the last day of finals week, at midnight
| *the last day of finals week, at 5pm
| the last day of finals week, at 5pm, but if you ask nicely I'll extend it to midnight
| the last day of class, by the end of the class period

## Drop-In Office Hours

My drop-in office hours are times that I set aside, so that students can drop
in and ask for help. You do not need to make an appointment. You can just
drop-in. If you cannot make my drop-in office hours, ask for an appointment.

:::{.no-print}
```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
16 Drop-in office hours are
| by appointment only
| a time for me to be alone in my office without being bothered by students
| *times when you can drop by and ask for help
| *times when you can drop by without an appointment
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
17 The best way to contact me about this course is
| via shortwave radio
| *via GroupMe

:::

## Course Objectives

A complete [list of course objectives](#learning-objectives-by-unit), 
 divided into units, can be found at the end of this syllabus.

This is a philosophy class. In philosophy, we try to think as clearly and
carefully as possible about anything and everything worth thinking about. So
that's my first broad course objective:

-    I want you to *get better at thinking as clearly and carefully as possible
 about anything and everything worth thinking about*.

Different philosophy classes are about different things. Ethics classes are
about good and bad, right and wrong. Epistemology classes are about knowledge.
Metaphysics classes are about the nature of reality. This class is a Logic
class: it is about the structure of reasoning itself. More specifically, it is
a class if Formal Logic, an abstract tool or model that we use to think about
the nature and structure of reasoning itself, similar to other abstract formal
tools, like algebra (for thinking about numbers and quantity) and geometry
(for thinking about shape and space). So here is my second broad
course objective:

-   I want you to learn *how to use formal logic to think more clearly and carefully about
    reasoning itself*.

The core concept we will explore is the concept of *validity*, as it applies
to *arguments*. An argument is valid when its conclusion *follows* from its
premises, in a sense of 'follows' that we will define and use precisely. So,
my second broad course objective:

-   I want you to *have a working understanding of the concept of validity and
    its application to arguments*.

If you are a philosophy major, think of this as your "formal methods in philosophy" class. 
If you are not a philosophy major, think of this as a "formal methods for
thinking about anything and everything worth thinking about" class. 

## Common Challenges and Barriers to Success

Many students have an unhappy history with math. This class is partly a math
class, and if you have an unhappy history with math, that can trigger old
anxieties. I assure you, formal logic is *much simpler* than any math you have
done before. I know many people who were "bad at math" but good at logic. And
while sometimes what we are doing will look like algebra, it is not.

But I also realize that this won't make the anxieties go away. That is
something you will have to work through.

This class involves thinking about language in a math-y way,
and thinking about math in a language-y way.
It combines ways of thinking that you have been taught to keep separate
(for no good reason, as far as I can see).
This tends to make everyone uncomfortable!
Students who identify as "good with language" but "bad at math"
 struggle with the "math-y" bits.
Students who identify as "good at math" but "bad with language"
 struggle with the "language-y" bits.
Students who think of themselves as good at both
 can still struggle when asked to put both together.

Finally, this is not a course in abstract theory, and it is not a class that
asks you to memorize and regurgitate facts.
It is a course that asks you to learn *how* to solve different kinds of
problems. Learning *how* to do something takes *practice*, and practice takes
*time*. The course is designed to maximize your opportunities to practice,
both inside and outside of class,
and maximize your opportunities to get help as you practice.
But I cannot maximize your *time*: that is a limited resource that you will
need to manage.


:::{.no-print}
```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
18 This class might be challenging for you because
| *it combines both mathematics and language
| it will be taught entirely in French 
| it is a course in abstract theory
| *learning how to solve the problems takes practice, and practice takes time
```

## Carnap.io

The readings and assignments for this course are all on Carnap.io. Carnap
is a tool for automatic machine grading of complicated logic problems. It is free,
but you will need a Google account to sign in.

-   If you don't already have a Google account, you can [create one for
    free](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp).
-   When you create your account on Carnap, you will be asked for your name
    and your University ID.
    -   Use your preferred name. If that\'s different from the name that will
        show up on my official roster, I'll figure it out.
    -   For your University ID, use your **ULID**, not your **UID**. Your ULID
        is the first part of your ISU email address. Your UID is your nine
        digit student ID number.

To enroll in Carnap, follow this link:

-   <https://carnap.io/enroll/ISU_112_FALL_2022>

If you already have an account on Carnap from a previous course, you will be asked if you want
to change your enrollment, and join this new course, ISU\_112\_FALL\_2022.
That is what you want to do. So click on the \"Change Enrollment\"

## Reggienet

You can track your progress on individual assignments on Carnap, by looking at
the progress bar at the top of each assignment. You can look to Reggienet's
gradebook to track your progress through the entire course. It will show you
how many units you have mastered, how many you have completed, and, for each
unit, it will give you a breakdown of your scores on each of the three parts.

Unfortunately, the Reggienet gradebook cannot be updated automatically from
Carnap. So your Reggienet gradebook will not always be up to date. I plan to
manually update the gradebook at least once a week, and more often toward the end of
the term.

:::{.no-print}
```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
19 The Reggienet gradebook

## Accommodations

Any student needing to arrange a reasonable accommodation for a
documented disability should contact Student Access and Accommodation
Services at 350 Fell Hall, 309-438-5853,
<http://studentaccess.illinoisstate.edu>.

I'm happy to work with you.

Also, if you come across accessibility issues with Carnap or other course materials,
 please let me know.

## Other Sources of Support

Life at college can get very complicated. Students sometimes feel
overwhelmed, lost, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with
relationship difficulties or diminished self-esteem. Many of these
issues can be effectively addressed with a little help. Student
Counseling Services (SCS) helps students cope with difficult emotions
and life stressors. Student Counseling Services is staffed by
experienced, professional psychologists and counselors, who are attuned
to the needs of college students. The services are free and completely
confidential. Find out more at <http://counseling.illinoisstate.edu> or
by calling 309-438-3655.

## Academic Misconduct

Academic integrity is expected and required. Students are expected to be
honest in all academic work. A student's placement of their name on any
academic exercise shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the
result of the student's own thought, effort, and study.

If you have questions, refer to the Code of Student Conduct, B1
(Academic Integrity), which outlines unacceptable behaviors in academic
matters, or talk to me. In certain circumstances (such as cheating or
plagiarism) I may be required to refer a student to Community Rights &
Responsibilities for a violation of Illinois State University's Code of
Student Conduct.

## Learning Objectives by Unit

### 1. Logic and Argument

This unit introduces our topic, logic, and some of the basic concepts we
use in logic, including *argument*, *premise*, *conclusion*, and
*proposition*. The unit has three primary learning objectives:

a.  I can identify premises and conclusions arguments presented in
    English.
b.  I can rewrite simple arguments in standard form.
c.  I can identify implicit premises.

### 2. Validity, Soundness, and Strength

This unit introduces the basic concepts needed for argument evaluation:
*validity*, *soundness*, and (inductive) *strength*. It also introduces
the idea of a *counterexample to validity*, and the concept of *formal
validity*. Learning objectives are:

a.  I can apply the definitions of validity, soundness, and strength to
    simple arguments.
b.  I can recognize informal counterexamples to validity.
c.  I can recognize counterexamples to formal validity.

### 3. Sentential Logic (SL)

This unit introduces the sentential logic---the logic of 'not', 'and',
'or', and 'if'. The specific learning objectives for this unit are:

a.  I know the canonical English for each connective.
b.  I know the characteristic truth table for each connective.
c.  I can parse symbolic sentences, both in official and informal
    notation, identifying the main connective and identifying the scope
    of each connective.

### 4. Translation in SL

This unit discusses some of the basic issues involved in translating
between English and our symbolic language. The specific learning
objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can translate symbolic sentences into canonical English
b.  I can symbolize English sentences involving 'if' and 'only if'
c.  I can symbolize English sentences involving stylistic variants
    ('but', 'unless', 'provided that', etc.)
d.  I can symbolize English sentences involving 'neither nor' and 'not
    both'.

### 5. Direct Derivations

This unit introduces a system of derivation for sentential logic, with
rules involving negations and conditionals. The specific learning
objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can identify instances of DN, MP and MT
b.  I can complete simple direct derivations.

### 6. Derivations with Assumptions

In this unit we continue to explore our system of derivation,
introducing more complicated forms of derivation that involve the idea
of making an assumption for the sake of argument. The specific learning
objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can complete simple conditional and indirect derivations.
b.  I can complete derivations that require sub-derivations, including
    derivations without premises
c.  I can use strategies, like showing the consequent, and showing the
    double negation, to complete more difficult derivations

### 7. Truth Tables for Sentences

In this unit, we learn how to use truth tables to explore the
truth-functional properties of sentences. The specific learning
objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can calculate the truth of a sentence on an interpretation
b.  I can use truth tables to determine whether or not a sentence is
    truth-functionally true, truth-functionally false, or
    truth-functionally contingent.

### 8. Truth Tables for Arguments

In this unit, we learn how to use truth tables to explore the
truth-functional properties of sets of sentences, and the
truth-functional properties of arguments. The specific learning
objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can use truth tables to determine whether or not two or more
    sentences are truth-functionally equivalent, and whether or not two
    or more sentences are truth-functionally consistent
b.  I can use truth tables to determine whether or not an argument is
    truth-functionally valid.

### 9. Translation in SL, continued

In this unit, we return to the project we began in Unit 4, and consider
some of the more complicated issues involved in translating between
English and our symbolic language. The specific learning objectives for
this unit are:

a.  I can use commas to disambiguate structurally complex sentences, and
    guide my symbolization of those sentences
b.  I can symbolize sentences with compound subjects and predicates
c.  I can symbolize sentences involving restricted quantifier phrases
    using disjunctions and conjunctions

### 10. 10. Derivations with '∧', '∨', and '↔︎'

In this unit, we expand the system of derivation to include rules for
all of our connectives. The specific learning objectives for this unit
are:

a.  I can identify instances of all the basic rules of sentential logic
b.  I can complete simple derivations involving all the connectives
c.  I can complete more complicated derivations involving all the
    connectives

### 11. Theorems and Derived Rules

We continue our exploration of the expanded system of derivation, and
introduce theorems and derived rules. The specific learning objectives
for this unit are:

a.  I can complete yet more complicated derivations, involving all the
    connectives, using strategies like showing the negation, showing the
    antecedent, and showing the double negation
b.  I have enabled several derived rules, including all the derived
    rules for using complex negations (NC, DM, NB), and I can use these
    rules to solve derivations

### 12. Predicate Logic (PL)

This unit introduces Predicate Logic, an extension of the Sentential
Logic studied in earlier units. The specific learning objectives for
this unit are:

a.  I can parse symbolic formulas, identifying the main connective, and
    identifying the scope of each connective.
b.  I can identify which variables in a formula are free and which are
    bound
c.  I can identify instances of generalizations, and generalizations of
    instances

### 13. Translation in PL

This unit explores some of the issues involved in translating between
English and Predicate Logic. The specific learning objectives for this
unit are:

a.  I can translate symbolic sentences into canonical English
b.  I can symbolize sweeping generalizations involving 'something',
    'everything', and 'nothing'
c.  I can symbolize restricted generalizations using 'all', 'some',
    'no', 'only', and 'just', including restricted generalizations using
    compound subjects
d.  I can symbolize sentences involving anaphoric pronouns and
    misleading uses of 'some' and 'any'.

### 14. Derivations in PL

This unit extends our system of derivation from Sentential Logic to
cover the new complications introduced by Predicate Logic. The specific
learning objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can complete derivations using UI, EG, and QN
b.  I can complete derivations using UD and ED
c.  I can complete derivations containing overlapping quantifiers

### 15. Truth and Countermodels

In this unit, we learn how to use models to explore the logical
properties of sentences and arguments in Predicate Logic. The specific
learning objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can construct a model to show that a sentence is not a logical
    truth in Predicate Logic
b.  I can construct a model to show that two sentences are not logically
    equivalent in Predicate Logic
c.  I can construct a model to show that an argument is not valid in
    Predicate Logic

### 16. Relations and Identity

In this unit, we extend our Predicate Logic to allow for multi-place
predicates, which allow us to express relations between things. The
specific learning objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can translate sentences involving multi-place predicates into
    canonical English
b.  I can symbolize sentences involving multi-place predicates
c.  I can symbolize sentences involving identity

### 17. Identity, continued

In this unit, we consider one special relation, Identity, and some of
the claims it allows us to express. The specific learning objectives for
this unit are:

a.  I can symbolize sentences involving phrases like 'everything but'
    and 'some other'
b.  I can symbolize sentences involving phrases like 'at least n', 'at
    most n', and 'exactly n'.
c.  I can symbolize definite descriptions in accordance with Russell's
    theory of definite descriptions

### 18. Derivations with Relations and Identity

In this unit, we extend our system of derivation to handle multi-place
predicates and identity. The specific learning objectives for this unit
are:

a.  I can complete derivations involving multi-place predicates and
    overlapping quantifiers
b.  I can complete derivations involving identity

## ISU General Education Objectives

Courses in the Quantitative Reasoning category of General Education
address the following program objectives:

I. knowledge of diverse human cultures and the physical and natural world,
   allowing students to

   a.  use theories and principal concepts, both contemporary and enduring,
       to understand technologies, diverse cultures, and the physical and
       natural world
   b.  *explain how the combination of the humanities, fine arts, natural and
       social sciences, and technology contribute to the quality of life for
       individuals and communities*

II. intellectual and practical skills, allowing students to

    a. make informed judgments
    b. analyze data to examine research questions and test hypotheses
    c. *report information effectively and responsibly*

III. personal and social responsibility, allowing students to

     a. demonstrate ethical decision making 
     b. demonstrate the ability to think reflectively

IV. integrative and applied learning, allowing students to

    a.  identify and solve problems
    b.  transfer learning to novel situations
    c.  *work effectively in teams*

Primary outcomes are indicated in plain text and secondary outcomes are
indicated in italics.

Phew! That's a lot of boiler plate.
Did you hear the story about the [professor who hid $50, and told students
where to find it on his
syllabus](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/18/us/tennessee-professor-syllabus-money-trnd/index.html)?
I am afraid I have not done the same. Do I look like I'm made of money?!!

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
20 According to the ISU General Education Objectives, a course in Quantitative Reasoning is supposed to (select all correct answers)
| *teach you personal and social responsibility, allowing (enabling?) you to demonstrate ethical decision making
| teach you how to cook, allowing (enabling?) you to cook quick and easy healthy meals on a budget
| *teach you about cultures and the physical and natural world (but not math?), allowing (enabling?) you to justify each unit of the university, on the (dubious!) grounds that it contributes to quality of life
| teach some aspect of quantitative reasoning
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=20}
Can we all pause to appreciate the absurdity of this list of objectives,
 for a course in Quantitative Reasoning?!
