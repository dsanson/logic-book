# Relations and Identity

:::

In this unit, we extend PL to allow for multi-place
predicates, which allow us to express relations between things. The
specific learning objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can translate sentences involving multi-place predicates into
    canonical English
b.  I can symbolize sentences involving multi-place predicates
c.  I can symbolize sentences involving identity

 
## Multi-place Predicates

A single-place or *monadic* predicate is a predicate that takes a single
argument. Examples include '\_\_\_ is a frog', '\_\_\_ is green', '\_\_\_
hops', and so on. So far, in our treatment of PL, we have
confined ourselves to single-place predicates.

A multi-place or *polyadic* predicate is a predicate that takes more than one
argument. Examples include '\_\_\_ loves \_\_\_', '\_\_\_ is greater than
\_\_\_', and '\_\_\_ is between \_\_\_ and \_\_\_'. In this chapter, we extend
our treatment of PL to include multi-place predicates.

Single-place predicates are well-suited for ascribing *properties*
or *features* to a thing, e.g.,

::: displayed
-   Kermit *is green*.
-   Dwayne Johnson *is strong*.
-   2 *is even*.
:::

They can also be used to describe what *kind* of thing something is:

::: displayed
-   Kermit *is a frog*.
-   Dwayne Johnson *is a celebrity*.
-   2 *is a natural number*.
:::

Multi-place predicates are well-suited for expressing *relations* between
things:

::: displayed
-   Dwayne Johnson *is stronger than* Kermit.
-   Taylor Swift *is better than* Justin Bieber.
-   3 *is greater than* 2.
-   3 *is between* 2 and 4.
:::

Here is an example of this in action. Consider the argument:

:::standardform
-   LeBron loves Russ
-   Somebody loves Russ 
:::

First, we need a scheme of abbreviation:

:::soa
| H(x): $x$ is a person
| L(x,y): $x$ loves $y$
| a: Russ
| b: LeBron
:::

Note the second item in our scheme, 'L(x,y)'. That's a two-place predicate. It
looks a lot like a one-place predicate, but instead of a single variable, it
takes two variables as its arguments. Using this scheme, our argument looks
like this:

::: {.displayed}
-   L(b,a): LeBron loves Russ
-   ∃x(H(x) ∧ L(x,a)): Somebody loves Russ
:::

As stated, the argument isn't valid. We need to add the implicit premise that
LeBron is a person:

::: {.displayed}
-   L(b,a): LeBron loves Russ
-   H(b): LeBron is a person
-   ∃x(H(x) ∧ L(x,a)): Somebody loves Russ
:::

Perhaps you can already see how you would go about deriving this argument?
First, use ADJ to conjoin the two premises. Then use EG to generalize over the
'b's.

Compare this to a slightly different argument, which is also valid:

::: {.displayed}
-   L(b,a): LeBron loves Russ
-   H(b): Russ is a person
-   ∃x(H(x) ∧ L(b,x)): LeBron loves somebody
:::

The reasoning is basically the same, except this time, we existentially
generalize not over LeBron but over Russ---not over the lover, but over the
beloved.

Finally, compare those two arguments to yet another argument, which is also
valid:

::: {.displayed}
-   L(b,a): LeBron loves Russ
-   H(a): Russ is a person
-   H(b): Russ is a person
-   ∃x∃y(H(x) ∧ H(y) ∧ L(x,y)): Somebody loves somebody
:::

----

Two-place predicates are useful for expressing simple *binary*
relations---relations that hold between two things. But not all relations are
binary. For example:

:::displayed
| Normal is between Chicago and St. Louis
:::

Betweenness is a *ternary* relation: a relation that holds between three
things. In this case, Normal, Chicago, and St. Louis. Our notation for
multi-place predicates easily extends to this case:

::: soa
| I(x,y,z) : $y$ is between $x$ and $z$
| a: Normal
| b: St Louis
| c: Chicago
:::

(Note the way I chose to arrange the arguments, so that the object that is
in between is the middle argument. That is entirely arbitrary.)

Here are several valid arguments, which we can represent using this notation:

::: {.standardform}
-   I(c,a,b): Normal is between Chicago and St Louis
-   ∃xI(c,x,b): Something is between Chicago and St Louis
:::

::: {.standardform}
-   I(c,a,b): Normal is between Chicago and St Louis
-   ∃xI(x,a,b): Normal is between something and St Louis
:::

::: {.standardform}
-   I(c,a,b): Normal is between Chicago and St Louis
-   ∃xI(c,a,x): Normal is between Chicago and something
:::
   
::: {.standardform}
-   I(c,a,b): Normal is between Chicago and St Louis
-   ∃x∃yI(x,y,b): Something is between something and St Louis
:::

::: {.standardform}
-   I(c,a,b): Normal is between Chicago and St Louis
-   ∃x∃y∃zI(x,y,z): Something is between something and something
:::

There are no limits on the number of "places" a predicate can have. Consider:

:::example
-  David says that according to Stephen Menn, Plato had more influence on Descartes than Aristotle
:::

We can represent this as a five-place relation:

:::soa
I(x,y,z,w,v): x says that according to y, z had more influence on w than v.
:::

## Official Syntax

We extend our language to allow multi-place predicates. This involves tweaking
[our definition of an [atomic formula]{.vocab}](11R#official-syntax) from
Unit 11:

-   Each sentence letter is an atomic formula.
-   Any predicate letter followed by a single term in parentheses is an atomic
    formula.
-   Any predicate letter followed by a comma-separated list of terms in
    parentheses is an atomic formula.

## Multi-place Predicates and Relations

The ability to express relations significantly increases
the expressive power of our language. Here are a few examples:

## Overlapping Quantifiers

Consider the English sentence,

::: {.displayed}
-   Something causes everything
:::

This is ambiguous. Do you see the ambiguity? On one reading, it means
that there is one single universal cause of all things---the one thing that
causes everything. On the other reading,
it just means that everything has some cause or other.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
10 Describe as best you can the two readings of the sentence.
```

Here is another sentence, displaying a similar ambiguity:

::: displayed
-   Someone gives birth to everyone
:::

On one reading, this sentence makes the obviously false claim that there is a universal
mother: one person who is the mother of us all. On the other reading, the
sentence makes the much more plausible claim that everyone was born from some
mother or other.

In PL, these different readings correspond to differences in the 
*scope* of overlapping quantifiers. For example, if I want to say unambiguously
that there is a single thing that is the cause of all things, I put the
existential quantifier *outside* the universal quantifier*:

:::wrapper
::: soasticky
| F(x,y): x causes y
| a: God
| b: Brexit
| c: COVID-19
:::

::: {.displayed}
-   There is something that is the cause of all things
-   ∃x∀yF(x,y)
:::

For example, suppose this thing is God. Then an instance of this claim would
be:

::: {.displayed}
-   ∀yF(a,y): God is the cause of all things.
:::

If instead I want to say unambiguously that each thing has a cause, without
supposing that each thing has the *same* cause, I put the universal quantifier
outside the existential quantifier:

:::displayed
-   Everything has some cause or other.
-   ∀y∃xF(x,y) 
:::

So, an instance of this claim would be:

:::displayed
-   ∃xF(x,b): Something caused Brexit 
:::

See the difference?

:::

Here is another example, illustrating the same sort of ambiguity:

:::wrapper
:::soasticky
| H(x): x is a person
| L(x,y): x loves y
| a: Raymond
:::

::: {.displayed}
| Everybody loves somebody.
:::

Does this mean that there is some one person who is the universal object of
our adoration? Someone who has that special status attributed to Raymond, in
the title of that crappy TV show from the 90s, 'Everybody Loves Raymond'? Or does it mean that
everybody has a beloved---nobody is a complete misanthrope---without supposing
that the beloved is the same for each of us?

Again, we can capture this difference by attending to the scope of overlapping
quantifiers:

::: {.displayed}
| Somebody is such that everybody loves them.
| ∃x(H(x)∧∀y(H(y)→L(y,x)))
:::

:::displayed
| Everybody is such that they love someone or other.
| ∀x(H(x) → ∃y(H(y)∧L(x,y))
:::

Again, to see the difference, think about instances. An instance of the first
is:

::: {.displayed}
| H(a)∧∀y(H(y)→L(y,a)))
| Raymond is a person that everybody loves
:::

While an instance of the second is,

:::displayed
| Raymond is a person that loves somebody.
| H(a) → ∃y(H(y)∧L(a,y))
:::

:::

Try it yourself!

:::wrapper
:::soasticky
| G(x,y) : x is greater than y
| N(x): x is a natural number
:::

``` {.Translate .FOL points="10"}
11 Ex(N(x)/\Ay(N(y)->G(x,y))) : Some number is such that it is greater than every number
```

::: solution

:::
:::

``` {.Translate .FOL points="10"}
12 Ax(N(x)->Ey(N(y)/\G(y,x))): Every number is such that some number is greater than it.
```

## Identity

There is something funny about some of the claims we symbolized in the last
section. For example,

::: displayed
-   Some number is such that it is greater than every number.
-   ∃x(N(x)∧∀yG(x,y))
:::

Notice that for this to be true, the number in question would have to be
*greater than itself*. That is, suppose 'a' is the number in question. Then,

::: displayed
-   a is greater than every number.
-   ∀yG(a,y)
:::

And, since that last claim is a universal generalization, it is true of
*absolutely everything*, including a *itself*:

::: displayed
-   G(a,a)
:::

The same thing happened with our example about something causing everything:

::: displayed
-   Something is such that it causes everything.
-   ∃x∀yF(x,y)
:::

Again, suppose that thing is God ('a'). Then it will
follow that God causes everything, including *herself*:

::: displayed
-   F(a,a)
:::

Some theologians make this claim! God, they say, causes everything, including
herself. But most deny this: God, they say, causes everything
*other than herself*. She is the one thing that has no cause.

Logic is not theology, but it would be nice if we could at least make some
logical sense theological claims. Here, to capture that "other than herself"
clause, we need to introduce the relation of *identity*. Identity is a
relation that each thing stands in to itself, and nothing stands in to
anything other than itself. So, using this relation, we can express the claim
we want:

::: {.displayed}
-   God causes everything other than herself.
-   Every x is such that, *if x is not identical to God*, the God causes x.
:::

To symbolize this, we need to expand our scheme of abbreviation:

::: soa
| F(x,y): x causes y
| I(x,y): x is identical to y
| a: God
:::

::: displayed
-   Every x is such that, *if x is not identical to God*, the God causes x.
-   ∀x(¬I(x,a)→F(a,x))
:::

Identity ends up being a really important relation. In fact, it is so
important, that we will give it is own special symbol, '='. And, following
long-standing notational conventions, we will write identity claims by placing
this symbol between the two terms it relates:

::: displayed
-   Every x is such that, *if x is not identical to God*, the God causes x.
-   ∀x(¬x=a → F(a,x))
:::

In our math classes, we all learned to call this symbol, '=', the "equals sign", and
we were taught to pronounce formulas like 'a=b' as "a is equal to b". But this
is a confusion. The symbol is not used to express *equivalence* or *equality*.
It is used to express *identity*. 'a=b' should be pronounced as "a is
identical to b", and '=' should be called the *identity sign*.

When is one thing identical to another? That's a trick question: nothing is
every identical to *another* thing. Each thing is identical to itself, and
itself alone. Still, identity claims can be useful. Consider:

::: displayed
-   Dwayne Johnson is identical to the Rock
-   a=b
:::

Here we are not saying that *two* things are identical. We are saying of one
person, who happens to go by two names, that he is the same thing as himself.

The conceptual distinction between *equality* and *identity*
is neatly illustrated by this meme:

:::illustration
![Celebrities That Look
Alike](https://reggienet.illinoisstate.edu/access/content/user/desanso/public/img/dwayne-looks-like-the-rock.png){alt="A
meme showing a picture of Dwayne Johnson and a picture of the Rock, captioned,
'Celebrities That Look Alike'"}
:::

At the risk of spoiling the joke, I want you to explain it:

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
13 Explain the joke. What is the actual relation between Dwayne Johnson and the Rock, and how does it differ from the suggested relation?
```

When two *non-identical* people look alike, we can say that they are *equal* in
appearance. When two *non-identical* things are the same size, we can say they are *equal* in
size. When two *non-identical* things are *equal in all ways*---that is, they are exactly
similar---then we can simply say that they are equal to each other.

For example, suppose Dwayne Johnson and John Cena have the *same weight*. Then
we can say that they have *equal* mass. They might also have *equal height*.
So they might be *equal* in many ways. But they are not *identical*, because
they are two people, not one.

Suppose Dwayne Johnson has an identical twin. That word, "identical", in
"identical twin", doesn't really mean *identical* in our sense. It means
*exactly similar*. Dwayne and his twin are two people, not one. It is just
that they are two people who are very similar to each other.

It is also true, of course, that Dwayne Johnson and the Rock are very similar
to each other. They have *equal*
mass, and *equal* height. They even have *equal* positions in the world:
everywhere Dwayne goes, the Rock goes too. But this case is different than the
case of Dwayne and John Cena, or Dwayne and his twin. In this case, it isn't
just that Dwayne and the Rock are equal; it's that they are identical. In this
case, there is just one person, not two.

The word 'same' in English is systematically ambiguous. Sometimes it means
'equal' or 'exactly similar', and sometimes it means 'identical'. Consider:

::: displayed
-   We ordered the same thing for dinner.
:::

This can mean two things. It can mean that the dishes we ordered are exactly
alike: perhaps each of us ordered our own small pepperoni pizza. Or it can mean that
we ordered a single thing: perhaps one large pepperoni pizza, to share.

Again, consider the sentence,

::: displayed
-   We wore the same sweater to the holiday party.
:::

This can mean that we are wearing distinct but matching sweaters. Or it can mean
that we have (awkwardly) squeezed into a single sweater (#questionablerelationshipgoals).

:::illustration
![](https://reggienet.illinoisstate.edu/access/content/user/desanso/public/img/twosie.jpg){alt="A
photo of two men wearing a single extra large sweater"}
:::

Even the word 'identity' shares in this ambiguity. It can either express the
relation I have been insisting upon, which we can call the relationship of
*numerical identity*: a matter of being one and the same thing. Or it can express a relation of *qualitative identity*,
which is a matter of being exactly alike.

Numerical identity
:   [Numerical identity]{.vocab} is the relation that each thing stands in to itself,
    and does not stand in to anything else.

Qualitative Identity
:   [Qualitative identity]{.vocab} is a relation between things that are
    exactly alike, but need not be numerically identical.

:::aside
Both numerical identity and qualitative identity are *relations*, expressed
using a two-place predicate. We also use
'identity' in a non-relational sense, as when we talk about racial identity,
gender identity, sexual identity, class identity, and so on. Identities, in
this sense, are a *properties*, not relations, and are expressed using
one-place predicates. Obviously, they will likely be very complicated properties,
and will depend in all sorts of interesting ways on an underlying tangle of
social relations. But the logical form of an identity claim, like, 'I am
trans', or 'I am cis', is a one-place not a two-place predicate.
:::

Which of these two relations is expressed by the symbol, '='?
Consider the mathematical sentence, '2 + 2 = 4'. This tells us that the sum of
2 and 2 is the number 4. That is a relation of *numerical identity*: the thing
you get when you add 2 to 2 is the very same thing as the thing we refer to as
the number 4. It isn't that we have here two distinct numbers that happen to
be equivalent: two mathematical twins, as it were. No. We have the same
number, described in two different ways, just like Dwayne and the Rock.
