## Introduction

This unit introduces our topic, logic, 
 and introduces several key concepts that will play a central role in our
 study of logic.

The learning objectives for this unit are:

-   You have a basic understanding of what [logic]{.vocab} is.
-   You can apply the concepts of an [argument]{.vocab}, a [premise]{.vocab}, and a
    [conclusion]{.vocab} to short argumentative passages in English.
-   You can apply the concepts of [validity]{.vocab} and [soundness]{.vocab}
    to simple arguments in standard form.

## What is logic?

Logic is the business of evaluating arguments, sorting good ones from
bad ones. In everyday language, we sometimes use the word 'argument' to
refer to belligerent shouting matches. If you and a friend have an
argument in this sense, things are not going well between the two of
you. This is not the kind of 'argument' that will concern us. Arguments
in the logical sense aren't events that happen between people; a logical
argument is structured to give someone a reason to believe some
conclusion. Here are two examples of such arguments:

:::standardform
-   It is raining.
-   When it rains, everyone outside without an umbrella gets wet.
-   You should take an umbrella when you go out.
:::

:::standardform
-   If you want a pet, you should either get a cat or a dog.
-   You are allergic to cats.
-   If you want a pet, you should get a dog.
:::

The three dots, '∴', on the last line of each argument mean 'therefore'.
They indicate that the final sentence is the *conclusion* of the
argument. The other sentences are *premises* of the argument. If you
believe the premises, then the argument provides you with a reason to
believe the conclusion.

This unit introduces some basic concepts that we use when thinking about
arguments. These concepts will be with us throughout the course.

## Arguments

Every argument has a conclusion. [The [conclusion]{.vocab} is the claim the
argument is trying to establish.]{.def} [The [premises]{.vocab} are starting-points,
used to lend to support to the conclusion.]{.def}
Often, the conclusion is signified or marked
by words like 'so' or 'therefore'. Premises might be marked by words
like 'because'. These words can give a clue as to just what the argument
is supposed to be.

[premise indicators]{.vocab}
:   since, because, given that, for

[conclusion indicators]{.vocab}
:   therefore, hence, thus, so

In a natural language like English, arguments sometimes start with
their premises and end with their conclusions, but not always:

:::example
You shouldn't major in philosophy, since philosophy is a useless major.
:::

This is an argument. It offers a premise in support of a conclusion. But the
conclusion is stated first, followed by the premise. The
conclusion is that *you shouldn't major in philosophy*. The premise that is
offered in support of this conclusion is that *philosophy is a useless major*.
See how the word "since" helps guide us, by indicating that *philosophy is a
useless major* is the premise?

In this course, we will represent arguments by putting them in "standard
form". [An argument in [standard form]{.vocab} is a list of sentences, where
the last sentence in the list, marked by '∴', is the conclusion, and the
earlier sentences in the list are the premises.]{.def} Here is the argument
above, rewritten in standard form:

:::standardform
-   Philosophy is a useless major.
-   You shouldn't major in philosophy.
:::

When an argument is written in standard form, you can tell at a glance which
parts are the premises and which part is the conclusion. When an argument is
written in ordinary English, this is not always so easy:

:::example
We need to address carbon emissions, because if we don't, the effects of
global warming will only get worse, and we don't want that to happen.
:::

Can you identify the conclusion of this argument?
First, look for premise indicators and conclusion indicators.
Second, ask yourself: if someone said this to me, what are they trying to convince me of?

In this case, the word 'because' is a premise indicator:

:::example
We need to address carbon emissions, **because** if we don't, the effects of
global warming will only get worse, and we don't want that to happen.
:::

And the conclusion---the claim being supported by reasons---is that *we need
to address carbon emissions*. So here is the argument in standard form:

::: standardform
-   If we don't address carbon emissions, the effects of global warming will
    only get worse
-   We don't want the effects of global warming to get worse.
-   We need to address carbon emissions.
:::

Notice that this argument has *two* premises and *one* conclusion. For us, an
argument can only have one conclusion. If someone argues for more than one
conclusion, we will represent that as more than one argument: one argument for
each conclusion. There is no limit on how many premises an argument can have.
So far, we have seen examples of arguments with one or two premises, but that
is just because we are looking at relatively simple examples.

Here is another argument:

:::example
Other animals eat meat, **so** it is okay for humans to eat meat.
:::

I've highlighted the indicator word in bold. Does that word indicate a premise
or a conclusion?

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
1  In this argument,
| *'so' is a conclusion indicator
| 'so' is a premise indicator
| the conclusion is 'other animals eat meat'
| *the conclusion is 'it is okay for humans to eat meat'
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
2 Rewrite the argument in standard form. (Type a period '.' followed by a colon ':' for the 'therefore' sign: '.:')
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=2}
Since this is an open-ended question, you get credit for trying. But you
should compare your answer to the correct answer:

::: standardform
-   Other animals eat meat.
-   It is okay for humans to eat meat.
:::

If you had something else, do you understand why this is correct and what you had
was wrong? If not, that's okay! I don't expect you to *already know* how to do
this. Keep reading, and see if that helps you understand better. If you are
still confused by the end of this reading assignment, that's fine: ask about
it in class, and we can talk through it together.
:::

Here is another argument. Again, I have highlighted the premise and conclusion
indicators in bold. Can you figure out the structure of the argument?

:::example
Morality is objective, and **therefore** God exists, **for, after all**, without God, there
  would be no objective right and wrong.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
3  In this argument,
| *'therefore' is a conclusion indicator
| 'therefore' is a premise indicator
| 'for' is a conclusion indicator 
| *'for' is a premise indicator 
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=3}
Note that this argument has *two* premises.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
4  In this argument,
| *the conclusion is 'God exists'. 
| the conclusion is 'God exists, for, after all, without God, there would be no objective right and wrong'. 
| *'Without God there would be no objective right and wrong' is a premise.
| 'God exists' is a premise
| *'Morality is objective' is a premise
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
5 Rewrite the argument in standard form.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=5}  
The word 'therefore' marks 'God exists' as the conclusion, and the phrase 'for,
after all' marks 'Without God, there would be no objective right or wrong' as
a premise. That leaves 'Morality is objective' unmarked: it is another
premise:

::: standardform
-   Morality is objective.
-   Without God, morality would not be objective.
-   God exists.
:::
:::

For more practice identifying premises and conclusions, see the exercises for
this unit.

In this course, we will mostly be working with arguments that have already
been put into standard form. So, for our purposes, [An [argument (in the
technical sense)]{.vocab} is a
list of sentences; the last sentence in the list is the [conclusion (in the
technical sense)]{.vocab};
the other sentences in the list are the [premises (in the technical sense)]{.vocab}.]{.def}

Notice that this definition is quite general. Consider this example:

:::standardform
-   Classrooms at ISU are equipped with that latest in pencil sharpening
    technology.
-   The present Queen of England hates corgis.
-   If every donkey is an animal, every animal is a donkey.
:::

It may seem odd to call this an argument, but by our definition, it is.
Of course, it is a terrible argument.
The two premises have nothing at all to do with
the conclusion. (Moreover, they are both false.) Nevertheless,
given our definition, it still counts as an argument --- albeit a bad
one. 

## Sentences and Propositions

The premises and conclusions of arguments are complete sentences. 
But not just any English sentence is suitable for figuring in an argument. For
example, questions count as grammatical sentences of English, but
logical arguments never have questions as premises or conclusions. We
are interested especially in sentences that can be true or false.

The sorts of sentences that can be true or false are the sorts of sentences
that offer up *information*, and aim to describe the way things are. We say
that such sentences express *propositions*. Sentences that don't express
propositions might instead express questions, commands, or hopes.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
6 'Eating meat'
| is a complete sentence
| *is not a complete sentence
| can be a premise
| *cannot be a premise
| can be a conclusion
| *cannot be a conclusion
| can be true or false
| *cannot be true or false
7 'Tigers eat meat'
| *is a complete sentence
| is not a complete sentence
| *can be a premise
| cannot be a premise
| *can be a conclusion
| cannot be a conclusion
| *can be true or false
| cannot be true or false
8 'Do you have any crackers?' 
| *is a complete sentence
| is not a complete sentence
| expresses a proposition
| *expresses a question
| expresses a command
| expresses a hope
| can be true or false
| *cannot be true or false
9 The sentence, 'May the force be with you!'
| *is a complete sentence
| is not a complete sentence
| expresses a proposition
| expresses a question
| expresses a command
| *expresses a hope
| can be true or false
| *cannot be true or false
10 The sentence, 'We have no bananas.'
| *is a complete sentence
| is not a complete sentence
| *expresses a proposition
| expresses a question
| expresses a command
| expresses a hope
| *can be true or false
| cannot be true or false
```

We will not be theorizing about questions and other non-propositional
sentences. We are interested in arguments, and the only kind of sentence that
can figure as a premise or conclusion of an argument is a sentence that
expresses a proposition. So, for this purposes of this course, we give the
word 'sentence' a technical meaning: [A [sentence]{.vocab} is a sentence that
expresses a proposition, i.e., a sentence that can be true or false.]{.def}

Don't confuse the idea of a sentence that can be true or false with the
difference between fact and opinion. 'Birds have hollow bones'
and 'Wyoming has more residents than Illinois' make claims about matters of
fact, while you might think that 'The U.S. invasion of Iraq was
unjustified' and 'Almonds are yummy' state matters of opinion. But these are
all examples of sentences that can be true or false, and can figure as
premises and conclusions in arguments. 

It is also important to keep clear the distinction between something's
being *true* and something's being *known*. A sentence (in our technical
sense) is the kind of thing that can be true or false; that doesn't mean you'll always be able
to tell whether it is true or false. For example, 'there are an even
number of humans on Earth right now' is a sentence. It is either true or
false, even though it is pretty much impossible to tell which.
Similarly, there are controversial propositions, where people disagree
about whether they are true or false, and where it seems very difficult
to settle the debate. We deal with such propositions all the time in
philosophy classes. Some examples:

:::example
-   God exists.
-   Free will is an illusion.
-   Freedom of expression requires restrictions on oppressive speech.
:::

Each of these sentences is either true or false, even if we do not agree about
them, and debates aren't likely to settle the matter. 

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
11 Which of the following count as sentences, in our technical sense?
| *The United States is inherently different from all other nations, and so destined and entitled to be the most powerful nation on Earth.
| *American exceptionalism is just cover for American imperalism.
| Go to sleep!
| *A good night's sleep will help you feel better in the morning.
| Are there any donuts in the kitchen?
| *There are donuts in the kitchen.
| *If there are donuts in the kitchen, then you should eat them.
| *You can't always get what you want.
| *The universe is vast and meaningless.
| *Two plus two is five.
| *Either two plus two is five or two plus two is four.
| *I don't enjoy answering multiple choice questions. 
| What a beautiful sunrise!
| *The sunrise is beautiful.
| *We should wake up this early more often.
| The rain in Spain.
| May you find happiness and fulfillment in all that you do.
| *Riding rollercoasters is fun.
```


```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
12 <p>Sometimes the premise or conclusion of an argument will be phrased as a question, but is really meant to express a proposition. Can you put this argument into standard form, rephrasing the conclusion as a sentence that expresses a proposition, rather than a question?</p> <div class="example"> <ul> <li>How can anyone think that it is okay to eat meat? Meat comes from animals, and animals are living creatures with feelings, just like us.</li> </ul> </div>
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=12}  
Your answer should look something like this:

:::standardform
-   Meat comes from animals.
-   Animals are living creatures with feelings.
-   It is not okay to eat meat.
:::
:::

## Two ways arguments can go wrong

Consider the argument that you should take an umbrella from above:

:::standardform
1.   It is raining.
2.   When it rains, everyone outside without an umbrella gets wet.
3.   You should take an umbrella when you go out.
:::

If premise (1) is false---if as a matter of fact, it is not raining outside,
but is sunny---then this argument fails. It does not establish that you should
take an umbrella. Or suppose premise (2) is false. Maybe not everyone outside
gets wet. (Maybe some people are able to stay under awnings.) Then, once
again, the argument does not establish its conclusion. Arguments only succeed
when all their premises are true.

Suppose both premises *are* true. It really is raining heavily, and
we're talking about an area where there's no protection from the rain
other than umbrellas, so anyone outside without an umbrella will
get wet. Now does the argument show you that you should
take an umbrella? It certainly seems to lend some support in that
direction. But notice that it's still not *conclusive*. There are still
*possible* ways the conclusion might be false. Maybe you
like getting wet! Then, even if it is raining heavily, and even if
everyone who goes outside without an umbrella when it rains gets wet,
that doesn't give you a reason to take the umbrella.

A good argument --- or at least, an argument that is good in one
particularly interesting way --- *compels* its conclusion.

So it seems that there are two ways an argument could be weak. First,
one or more of the premises might be false. An argument gives you a
reason to believe its conclusion only if you believe its premises.
Second, the premises might fail to support the conclusion, or fail to
support it sufficiently strongly. Even if the premises were true, the
form of the argument might be weak. The example we just considered is
weak in both ways.

Consider another example:

:::standardform
1.  You are reading this book.
2.  This is a logic book.
3.  You are a logic student.
:::

In a straightforward and ordinary sense, this is not a terrible
argument. The premises are true. And they do offer some support for the
conclusion. Most people who read this book are logic students. Still, it
is *possible* for someone besides a logic student to read this book. If
the Provost carefully reads this book in order to find out whether I'm
criticizing the administration, that doesn't make him a logic
student. So the premises of this argument, even though they are true,
do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.

Here is a slightly different argument about rain and umbrellas:

:::standardform
1.   It is raining.
2.   When it rains, everyone outside without an umbrella gets wet.
3.   If you go outside without an umbrella, you will get wet. 
:::

This argument has a different conclusion that the previous rain and umbrellas
argument. The conclusion of the previous rain and umbrellas argument was, "You should
take an umbrella if you go out." But we saw that this conclusion doesn't
really follow from the premises. Even if it is true that it is raining, and
true that everyone outside without an umbrella gets wet, that might not give
you a reason to take an umbrella, since you might *want* to get wet.

But the new conclusion does follow. If it is true that it is raining, and it
is true that everyone outside without an umbrella gets wet when it rains, then
it *follows* that, if you go outside without an umbrella, you will get wet.

## Validity

In logic, we are interested in arguments whose premises *guarantee*
their conclusions. We call such arguments 'deductively valid' or just
'valid.' Even though we might count the first umbrella argument, or the logic book
argument, as good arguments in some sense, they are not valid; that is,
they are 'invalid.' One important task of logic is to sort valid
arguments from invalid arguments.

[An argument is deductively [valid]{.vocab} if and only if it is impossible for all the
premises to be true while the conclusion is false.]{.def} (We'll say a bit more
about just what we mean by 'impossible' below.)

That's our official *definition* of validity. In this class, we will use the
word 'valid' with this stipulated technical meaning. In ordinary English, to
say something is 'valid' means, somewhat vaguely, that it is good. (Think of a
'valid point' or a 'valid perspective'.) In logic, a valid argument is one
that has this very specific feature: it's impossible for the premises to be
true if the conclusion is false. (Side note: This use of 'valid' is
commonplace throughout philosophy. Philosophy professors tend to wince and get
annoyed when students use the word 'valid' in its imprecise colloquial sense.
You can help stay on their good sides by only saying something is 'valid' when
you mean that it is an argument whose premises are inconsistent with the
falsity of its conclusion.)

Notice that validity does *not* require that the premises be true.
Consider this example:

::: standardform
1.  Oranges are either fruits or musical instruments.
2.  Oranges are not fruits.
3.  Oranges are musical instruments.
:::

This is a valid argument. It is impossible for the premises to be true
if the conclusion is false. Since it has a false premise --- premise (2)
--- it does not actually establish its conclusion, but it is valid: *if* both
premises *were* true, *then* the
conclusion *would* necessarily be true.

Since this is a valid argument that is also in some important sense a bad
argument, this shows that validity isn't the only feature we care about
in arguments. [An argument is [sound]{.vocab} if and only if it is valid and all of its
premises are true.]{.def} For example, this argument is sound:

::: standardform
1.  Oranges are either fruits or musical instruments.
2.  Oranges are not musical instruments.
3.  Oranges are fruits.
:::

For reasons that will emerge, logic tends to focus primarily on
validity, rather than soundness. But in other philosophy classes, you will
often focus on both.

We've seen that a valid argument does not need to have true premises or
a true conclusion. Conversely, having true premises and a true
conclusion is also not enough to make an argument valid. Consider this
example:

:::standardform
1.  Donald Trump is a U.S. citizen.
2.  Vladimir Putin is a Russian citizen.
3.  State Farm is the largest employer in Bloomington-Normal.
:::

The premises and conclusion of this argument are, as a matter of fact,
all true. Nevertheless, this is quite a poor argument. This is related
to the fact that the premises have nothing to do with the conclusion.
More precisely, the definition of validity is not satisfied: it is
possible for the premises to be true while the conclusion is false.
Although the conclusion is *actually* true, it is *possible* for the
premises of this argument to be true while the conclusion is false. We
may imagine, for example, that ISU hires 20,000 additional employees, while
State Farm remains the same size, Trump remains a US citizen, and Putin
remains a Russian citizen. In such a
scenario, which is possible, the premises would be true, while the conclusion is
false.

The important thing to remember is that validity is not about the actual
truth or falsity of the sentences in the argument. Instead, it is about
whether the truth of the premises is *incompatible with*
the falsity of the conclusion.

The definition of validity centrally invokes the notion of
impossibility. What it means for a sentence to be *impossible* is that
there is no possible way for it to be true. Impossible sentences don't
just *happen* to be false; they *must* be false. Consider the sentence,
'The White Sox lost their last game.' As it happens, at the time I'm
writing, that's false. They actually won. But it's not impossible; they
might have lost, if a few things had gone differently. So that sentence
is false, but not impossible.

By contrast, blatant contradictions like 'the White Sox won the game and
the White Sox lost the game' *are* impossible. This sentence doesn't
just *happen* to be false. It couldn't *possibly* be true.

Even falsehoods that are really obviously false, and for which it's hard to
imagine how they could be true, might be *possible*. It's not *impossible*
that pigs could fly. Someone might invent powerful wings for them. When we're
interested in impossible sentences in logic, we really mean *absolutely
impossible*, not just *practically impossible*. The best examples are
contradictions.

So to apply the definition of validity, we consider whether there is any
possibility, no matter how far-fetched, where the premises are true and
the conclusion is false.

Here are some more arguments. Can you figure out which ones are valid, and
which not?

:::standardform
1.  Socrates is a man.
2.  All men are carrots.
3.  Socrates is a carrot.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
13 This argument is:
| *valid
| invalid
| sound
| *unsound
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=13}
We imagine a possible situation in which all men *are* carrots. That is
far-fetched, but it is not absolutely impossible. And we imagine that, in this
situation, Socrates is still a man. In this situation, the conclusion cannot
be false: Socrates must be a
carrot. If we try to imagine that he is not a carrot, that is inconsistent
with the truth of the two premises.

Although the argument is valid, is is not sound: a sound argument is both
valid AND all of its premises are true. In this case, the argument is not
sound because the second
premise is false.
:::

:::standardform
1.  Socrates is a man.
2.  Some men are carrots.
3.  Socrates is a carrot.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
14 This argument is:
| valid
| *invalid
| sound
| *unsound
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=14}
We imagine a possible situation in which some men *are* carrots. That is
far-fetched, but it is not absolutely impossible. And we imagine that, in this
situation, Socrates is still a man. It is consistent with this that he *not*
be a carrot. Only *some* men are carrots, not *all*, so we are not forced to
admit that Socrates is a carrot.

Since the argument is not valid, it cannot be sound: a sound argument is both
valid AND all of its premises are true. In this case, the argument is not
sound because it is not valid, and it is also not sound because the second
premise is false.
:::

::: standardform
1.  Abe Lincoln was either born in Illinois or he was once president.
2.  Abe Lincoln was never president.
3.  Abe Lincoln was born in Illinois.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
15 This argument is:
| *valid
| invalid
| sound
| *unsound
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=15}
The first premise tells us that there are two options for Abe: either he is
born in Illinois, or he is never President. The second premise tells us that
he was never President. This is actually false, but we can easily imagine it
to be true. So, imagining that both those premises are true, can the
conclusion be false in that situation? No: if those are the two options for
Abe, and he doesn't satisfy the second option, then he must satisfy the first,
by being born in Illinois.

This argument is valid, but it is not sound, because the second premise is
false.
:::

::: standardform
1.  Abe Lincoln was either born in Illinois or he was born in Indiana.
2.  Abe Lincoln was not born in Indiana.
3.  Abe Lincoln was born in Illinois.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
16 This argument is:
| *valid
| invalid
| *sound
| unsound
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=16}
Notice that this argument has the same form as the previous argument. There
are two options for Abe, and he doesn't satisfy one of them, so he must
satisfy the other. Any argument of this form will be valid.

In this case, the argument also has true premises. So it is also sound.
:::

:::standardform
1.  If the world were to end today, then I would not need to get up tomorrow morning.
2.  I will need to get up tomorrow morning.
3.  The world will not end today.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
17 This argument is:
| *valid
| invalid
```

## Validity and Strength

Briefly, note that some arguments are *strong* even though they are not
valid. For example:

:::standardform
1.  In my experience, students who are often absent in this class don't usually get
    good grades.
2.  If you are often absent in this class, you won't get a good grade.
:::

The premise, if true (it is) provides strong support for the conclusion, but
the argument is not valid. It is *possible* that for you to miss a bunch of
classes and still get a good grade in this class, it is just *very unlikely*.

We say that arguments like this are *strong*, or *inductively strong*, even
though they are not (deductively) *valid*. A lot of our reasoning involves
arguments like this, that are meant to be *strong* but not meant to be
*valid*. 

The strength of an argument is something that comes in degrees. Some arguments
are very weak; some are pretty strong; some are very strong. You might think
of valid arguments as the strongest possible arguments: an argument that is
not valid might make its conclusion quite likely, given the truth of its
premises; but a valid argument *absolutely guarantees* the truth of its
conclusion, given the truth of its premises.
