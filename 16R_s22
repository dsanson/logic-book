# Relations and Identity

:::

::: {.auto-tally}
:::

In this unit, we extend PL to allow for multi-place
predicates, which allow us to express relations between things. The
specific learning objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can translate sentences involving multi-place predicates into
    canonical English
b.  I can symbolize sentences involving multi-place predicates
c.  I can symbolize sentences involving identity

 
## Multi-place Predicates

A single-place or *monadic* predicate is a predicate that takes a single
argument. Examples include '\_\_\_ is a frog', '\_\_\_ is green', '\_\_\_
hops', and so on. So far, in our treatment of PL, we have
confined ourselves to single-place predicates.

A multi-place or *polyadic* predicate is a predicate that takes more than one
argument. Examples include '\_\_\_ loves \_\_\_', '\_\_\_ is greater than
\_\_\_', and '\_\_\_ is between \_\_\_ and \_\_\_'. In this chapter, we extend
our treatment of PL to include multi-place predicates.

Single-place predicates are well-suited for ascribing *properties*
or *features* to a thing, e.g.,

::: displayed
-   Kermit *is green*.
-   Dwayne Johnson *is strong*.
-   2 *is even*.
:::

They can also be used to describe what *kind* of thing something is:

::: displayed
-   Kermit *is a frog*.
-   Dwayne Johnson *is a celebrity*.
-   2 *is a natural number*.
:::

Multi-place predicates are well-suited for expressing *relations* between
things:

::: displayed
-   Dwayne Johnson *is stronger than* Kermit.
-   Taylor Swift *is better than* Justin Bieber.
-   3 *is greater than* 2.
:::

We *can* try to express relations using single-place predicates. But when we
do, we fail to capture important features of their logical form. For example,
each of the following arguments is valid:

::: standardform
| [Adam loves Billy]{.premise .nn}
| [Some x is such that x loves Billy.]{.conclusion}
:::

::: standardform
| [Adam loves Billy]{.premise .nn}
| [Some y is such that Adam loves y.]{.conclusion}
:::

Suppose we try to capture what is going on here using single-place predicates:

:::wrapper
:::soasticky
| F(x): $x$ loves Billy
| G(y): Adam loves $y$
| a: Adam
| b: Billy
:::

This scheme of abbreviation forces us to make an awkward choice, when it comes
to symbolizing the premise of our two arguments. Is it:

::: displayed
-   F(a): Adam *loves Billy*.
:::

Or is it:

::: displayed
-   G(b): *Adam loves* Billy.
:::

If we opt for the first, our first argument is valid:

::: standardform
-   F(a): Adam loves Billy.
-   ∃xF(x): Some x is such that x loves Billy.
:::

But our second argument is not valid:

::: standardform
-   F(a): Adam loves Billy.
-   ∃yG(y): Some y is such that Adam loves y.
:::

And if we opt for the second, our second argument is valid:

::: standardform
-   G(b): Adam loves Billy.
-   ∃yG(y): Some y is such that Adam loves y.
:::

But our first argument is not valid:

::: standardform
-   G(b): Adam loves Billy.
-   ∃xF(x): Some x is such that x loves Billy.
:::

:::

These are bad results. We want a representation of 'Adam loves Billy' that
makes both arguments valid. The solution is to treat 'loves' as a *two-place*
predicate:

:::wrapper
:::soasticky
| L(x,y): $x$ loves $y$
| a: Adam
| b: Billy
:::

::: {.displayed}
-   L(a,b): Adam loves Billy
:::

Now we can offer a single representation of our premise, that allows us to
validly infer both conclusions:

::: {.displayed}
-   L(a,b) ⊢ ∃xL(x,b)
-   L(a,b) ⊢ ∃yL(a,y)
:::

And this allows us to go one step further. From 'Adam loves Billy', it follows that
*something* loves *something*:

::: displayed
-   L(a,b) ⊢ ∃x∃yL(x,y)
:::

----

Two-place predicates are useful for expressing simple binary
relations---relations that hold between two things. But not all relations are
binary. For example:

:::displayed
| Normal is between Chicago and St. Louis
:::

This doesn't describe a binary relations between two things. It describes a
*ternary* relation between three things: Normal, Chicago, and St. Louis.

:::wrapper
::: soasticky
| I(x,y,z) : $y$ is between $x$ and $z$
| a: Normal
| b: St Louis
| c: Chicago
:::

::: displayed
| Normal is between Chicago and St Louis
| $I(c,a,b)$
:::

Given this representation, we can see that each of the following arguments
is a valid instance of EG:

::: {.standardform}
-   I(c,a,b): Normal is between Chicago and St Louis
-   ∴ ∃xI(c,x,b): Something is between Chicago and St Louis
:::

::: {.standardform}
-   I(c,a,b): Normal is between Chicago and St Louis
-   ∴ ∃xI(x,a,b): Normal is between something and St Louis
:::

::: {.standardform}
-   I(c,a,b): Normal is between Chicago and St Louis
-   ∴ ∃xI(c,a,x): Normal is between Chicago and something
:::
   
And, again, we can go further, applying EG two or three times:

::: {.standardform}
-   I(c,a,b): Normal is between Chicago and St Louis
-   ∴ ∃x∃yI(y,x,b): Something is between something and St Louis
:::

::: {.standardform}
-   I(c,a,b): Normal is between Chicago and St Louis
-   ∴ ∃x∃y∃zI(y,x,z): Something is between something and something
:::

:::

We put no limit on the number of "places" a predicate can have.

## Official Syntax

We extend our language to allow multi-place predicates. This involves tweaking
[our definition of an [atomic formula]{.vocab}](12R#official-syntax) from
Chapter 12:

-   Each sentence letter is an atomic formula.
-   Any predicate letter followed by a single term in parentheses is an atomic
    formula.
-   Any predicate letter followed by a comma-separated list of terms in
    parentheses is an atomic formula.

## Multi-place Predicates and Relations

The ability to express relations significantly increases
the expressive power of our language. Here are a few examples:

## Overlapping Quantifiers

Consider the sentence,

::: {.displayed}
-   Something causes everything
:::

This sentence is ambiguous. Do you see the ambiguity? On one reading, it means
that there is as single universal cause of all things. On the other reading,
it just means that everything has some cause or other.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
10 Describe as best you can the two readings of the sentence.
```

Here is another sentence, displaying a similar ambiguity:

::: displayed
-   Someone gives birth to everyone
:::

On one reading, this sentence makes the claim that there is a universal
mother, some one person who is the mother of us all. On the other reading, the
sentence makes the much more plausible claim that everyone came from some
mother or other.

In PL, these different readings correspond to differences in the 
*scope* of overlapping quantifiers. For example, if I want to say unambiguously
that there is a single thing that is the cause of all things, I put the
existential quantifier *outside* the universal quantifier*:

:::wrapper
::: soasticky
| F(x,y): x causes y
| a: God
| b: Brexit
| c: COVID-19
:::

::: {.displayed}
-   There is something that is the cause of all things
-   ∃x∀yF(x,y)
:::

And if I want to say unambiguously that there each thing has a cause, without
supposing that each thing has the *same* cause, I put the universal quantifier
outside the existential quantifier:

:::displayed
-   Everything has some cause or other.
-   ∀y∃xF(x,y) 
:::

The differences in meaning here come out more clearly when we think about
instances. Here some instances of '∃x∀yF(x,y)': 

::: displayed
-   ∀yF(a,y)
-   ∀yF(b,y)
-   ∀yF(c,y)
:::

The first instance says that everything is such that God causes it. The second
says that everything is such that Brexit causes it. And the third says that
everything is such that COVID-19 causes it. Each of these instances claims,
of a specific thing, that it is the cause of all things. The existential
generalization, then, claim that there is something that is the cause of all
things.

And here are some instances of '∀y∃xF(x,y)':

::: displayed
-   ∃xF(x,a)
-   ∃xF(x,b)
-   ∃xF(x,c)
:::

The first says that something causes God. The second says that something
causes Brexit. The third says that something causes COVID-19. So the universal
generalization of these instances tells us that all things are like this:
each thing is such that something causes it.

:::

Here is another example, illustrating the same sort of ambiguity:

:::wrapper
:::soasticky
| H(x): x is a person
| L(x,y): x loves y
:::

::: {.displayed}
| Everybody loves somebody.
:::

Does this mean that there is some one person who is the universal object of
our adoration? Someone who has the special status attributed to Raymond, in
the title of the TV show, 'Everybody Loves Raymond'? Or does it mean that
everybody has a beloved---nobody is a complete misanthrope---without supposing
that the beloved is the same for each of us?

Again, we can capture this difference by attending to the scope of overlapping
quantifiers:

::: {.displayed}
| Somebody is such that everybody loves them.
| ∃x(H(x)∧∀y(H(y)→L(y,x)))
:::

:::displayed
| Everybody is such that they love someone or other.
| ∀x(H(x) → ∃y(H(y)∧L(x,y))
:::

(These examples are made more complicated by the fact that we are using
personal quantifiers, and so our claims are restricted to persons. But the
basic pattern is the same as we saw in the unrestricted case.)

:::

Try it yourself!

:::wrapper
:::soasticky
| G(x,y) : x is greater than y
| N(x): x is a natural number

```

12 Ax(N(x)->Ey(N(y)/\G(y,x))): Every number is such that some number is greater than it.
```

## Identity

There is something funny about some of the claims we symbolized in the last
section. For example,

::: displayed
-   Some number is such that it is greater than every number.
-   ∃x(N(x)∧∀yG(x,y))
:::

Notice that, for this to be true, the number in question would have to be
*greater than itself*. That is, suppose 'a' is the number in question. Then,

::: displayed
-   a is greater than every number.
-   ∀yG(a,y)
:::

And, since that last claim is a universal generalization, it is true of
*absolutely everything*, including a *itself*:

::: displayed
-   G(a,a)
:::

The same thing happened with our example about something causing everything:

::: displayed
-   Something is such that it causes everything.
-   ∃x∀yF(x,y)
:::

Again, call the thing that causes everything, whatever it is, 'a'. Then it will
follow that a causes everything, including *herself*:

::: displayed
-   F(a,a)
:::

Some theologians make this claim: God, they say, causes everything, including
herself. But many theologians deny this: God, they say, causes everything
*other than herself*; she is the one thing that has no cause.

To capture that "other than herself" clause, we need to introduce the relation
of *identity*. Identity is a relation that each thing stands in to itself, and
nothing stands in to anything other than itself. So, using this relation, we
can express the claim we want:

::: {.displayed}
-   God causes everything other than herself.
-   Every x is such that, *if x is not identical to God*, the God causes x.
:::

To symbolize this, we need to expand our scheme of abbreviation:

::: soa
| F(x,y): x causes y
| I(x,y): x is identical to y
| a: God
:::

::: displayed
-   Every x is such that, *if x is not identical to God*, the God causes x.
-   ∀x(¬I(x,a)→F(a,x))
:::

Identity ends up being a really important relation. In fact, it is so
important, that we will give it is own special symbol, '='. And, following
long-standing notational conventions, we will write identity claims by placing
this symbol between the two terms it relates:

::: displayed
-   Dwayne Johnson is identical to the Rock
-   Dwayne Johnson = the Rock
-   a=b
:::

In our math classes, we all learned to call this symbol the "equals sign", and
we were taught to pronounce formulas like 'a=b' as "a is equal to b". But this
is a confusion. The symbol is not used to express *equivalence* or *equality*.
It is used to express *identity*. 'a=b' should be pronounced as "a is
identical to b", and '=' should be called the *identity sign*.

What hangs on this? What is the distinction between *equality* and *identity*?
The distinction can be neatly illustrated with a meme:

:::illustration
![Celebrities That Look
Alike](https://reggienet.illinoisstate.edu/access/content/user/desanso/public/img/dwayne-looks-like-the-rock.png){alt="A
meme showing a picture of Dwayne Johnson and a picture of the Rock, captioned,
'Celebrities That Look Alike'"}
:::

At the risk of spoiling the joke, I want you to explain it:

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
13 Explain the joke. What is the actual relation between Dwayne Johnson and the Rock, and how does it differ from the suggested relation?
```

When two distinct people look alike, we can say that they are *equal* in
appearance. When two things are the same size, we can say they are *equal* in
size. When two things are *equal in all ways*---that is, they are exactly
similar---then we can simply say that they are equal to each other.

No doubt Dwayne Johnson is, in this sense, equal to the Rock.
But that's not because Dwayne and the Rock are two people who happen to be exactly alike.
It's because Dwayne *is* the Rock: they are not two people, but one.

This is related to an ambiguity, in English, with the word 'same'.
Consider the sentence,

::: displayed
-   We ordered the same thing for dinner.
:::

This can mean two things. It can mean that the dishes we ordered are exactly
alike: perhaps each of us ordered our own small pepperoni pizza. Or it can mean that
we ordered a single thing: perhaps one large pepperoni pizza, to share.

Again, consider the sentence,

::: displayed
-   We are wearing the same sweater.
:::

This can mean that we are wearing distinct but matching sweaters. Or it can mean
that we have (awkwardly) squeezed into a single sweater (#questionablerelationshipgoals).

:::illustration
![](https://reggienet.illinoisstate.edu/access/content/user/desanso/public/img/twosie.jpg){alt="A
photo of two men wearing a single extra large sweater"}
:::

The word 'identity' shares this ambiguity. It can either express a relation of
*numerical identity*, or it can express a relation of *qualitative identity*:

Numerical identity
:   [Numerical identity]{.vocab} is the relation that each thing stands in to itself,
    and does not stand in to anything else.

Qualitative Identity
:   [Qualitative identity]{.vocab} is a relation between things that are
    exactly alike, but need not be numerically identical.

:::aside
Both numerical identity and qualitative identity are *relations*. We also use
'identity' in a non-relational sense, as when we talk about racial identity,
gender identity, sexual identity, class identity, and so on. An identity, in
this sense, is a *property*, not a relation (perhaps a very complicated
socially constructed property). And it isn't just any property, but a property
that in some sense makes you *who you are*. 
:::

Which of these two relations is expressed by the symbol, '='?
Consider the mathematical sentence, '2 + 2 = 4'. This tells us that the sum of
2 and 2 is the number 4. That is a relation of *numerical identity*: the thing
you get when you add 2 to 2 is the very same thing as the thing we refer to as
the number 4. It isn't that we have here two distinct numbers that happen to
be equivalent. We have the same number, described in two different ways.
