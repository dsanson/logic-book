# Mastering Symbolic Logic

This is the source for the content of my open-source interactive logic "textbook",
[Mastering Symbolic
Logic](https://carnap.io/shared/dsanson@gmail.com/Book_s22).

This includes the reading, exercises, and supplements for each chapter. It
does not include the "Mastery Checks".

It is work in progress.

It depends heavily on my [custom css for
Carnap](https://github.com/dsanson/carnap-css) and my [custom javascript for
Carnap](https://github.com/dsanson/carnap-custom-js).
