## Introduction

**NOTE WELL**: I have posted "solution" videos, but I have not yet had the
chance to edit the subtitles. When the subtitles have been posted, this
message will disappear.


In this chapter, we introduce two new kinds of derivation.

The first, [Conditional Derivation (CD)]{.vocab},
 is for deriving conditionals.
Sometimes people say that it is impossible to prove a hypothetical.
Must be they don't know CD.

The second, [Indirect Derivation (ID)]{.vocab},
 is for deriving negations.
Sometimes people say that it is impossible to prove a negative.
Must be they don't know ID.

We also introduce [subderivations]{.vocab},
 which are derivations nested inside other derivations.

Using our new kinds of derivation,
 there are some sentences we can derive
 from no premises at all.
We call such sentences [theorems]{.vocab}.

The specific learning objectives for this unit are:

a.  I can complete simple conditional and indirect derivations.
b.  I can complete derivations that require sub-derivations.
c.  I can complete derivations that lack premises.

## Conditional Derivations


[People say]{.newthought} it is impossible to prove a hypothetical. 
If they were right, the logic of conditionals would not be very interesting.
But they are wrong.

Here is a mini lecture, introducing conditional derivations:

The following argument is obviously valid:

::: standardform
-   If she swallows a fly, then she swallows a spider.
-   If she swallows a spider, then she swallows a bird.
-   If she swallows a fly, then she swallows a bird.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
1 Suppose someone wasn't sure whether or not this conclusion follows from these premises. How might you go about trying to convince them that it does?
```

There is no one right answer to that question.
Building on the approach of the last chapter,
 we could isolate the *logical form* of the argument,
 and introduce a new inference rule
 for arguments of that form.

The first step is to symbolize each premise, 
 and the conclusion,
 so we can get a good look at the logical form.

Great! Here is the argument, in SL:

::: standardform
-   P→Q
-   Q→R
-   P→R
:::
::::

Abstracting from the example,
 we can formulate our rule:

::: standardform
-   []{.P} → []{.Q}
-   []{.Q} → []{.R}
-   []{.P} → []{.R}
:::

This rule is known as [Hypothetical Syllogism]{.vocab}. 
It reflects the *transitive property* of the conditional.

::: aside
'[Syllogism]{.vocab}' is another word for "argument", often (for historical
reasons) with the added restriction that the argument only have two premises.
:::

But we are not going to introduce this rule,
 Hypothetical Syllogism, 
 into our system.
Instead, we are going to do something 
 more general
 and more powerful:
 we are going to introduce a new form derivation.

How does one go about *proving* a that a conditional is true?
Informally, here is the idea:
 if you want to prove that a conditional is true,
 show that, from the assumption of its antecedent,
 its consequent follows.
For example, if we can show that,
 from the assumption that *she swallows a fly*,
 it follows that the old lady also *swallows a bird*,
 then we have proven that the conditional is true:

::: example
-   If she swallows a fly, then she swallows a bird.
:::

More formally,

::: proof
1.  [If she swallows a fly, then she swallows a bird.]{.show}
2.  [She swallows a fly. [AS]{.just}]{.indent}
3.  [If she swallows a fly, then she swallows a spider. [PR]{.just}]{.indent}
4.  [If she swallows a spider, then she swallows a bird. [PR]{.just}]{.indent}
5.  [She swallows a spider. [MP 2,3]{.just}]{.indent}
6.  [She swallows a bird. [MP 4,5]{.just}]{.indent}
7.  [:CD 6]{.qed}
:::

Do you see how this represents our reasoning? Let me walk you through it, step
by step:

-   We want to *show* that if she swallows a fly, she swallows a bird.
-   On line (2), we *assume*, for the sake of argument, that the old lady does
    swallow a fly. This is a new kind of move that we haven't seen before. We
    indicate that line (2) is an *assumption* by putting ':AS' as our
    justification.
-   On lines (3) to (6), we reason *from* that assumption (and the premises)
    to the conclusion that she swallows a bird. The reasoning involves two
    applications of Modus Ponens.

At this point, we have *proven* the conditional. We *assumed* she swallowed a
fly, and *proved* that, *if* that assumption is true, *then* she swallowed a
bird. So this brings us to our QED line:

-   On line (7), we announced that we have done what was needed to prove what
    we set out to show. We cite line (6), where we proved the *consequent* of
    our show line. And we justify this as a [Conditional Derivation
    (CD)]{.vocab}.

Now to see the same thing,
 but as an actual derivation in Carnap.

:::

::::::

Here is another example, illustrating how we can reason *to* the truth of a
conditional.
Suppose I want to convince you that,

::: example
-   If God exists, then we are not free.
:::

Here is my argument:

::: standardform
1.  If God exists, She controls everything.
2.  If She controls everything, everything that happens is part of Her plan.
3.  We are free only if we can make our own choices.
4.  If everything that happens is part of Her plan, we cannot make our own
    choices.
5.  If God exists, then we are not free.
:::

Here is an informal "proof" that this argument is valid:

> Suppose She exists. Then it follows from that and premise (1) that She
> controls everything, and it follows *that* and premise (2) that everything
> that happens is part of Her plan, and it follows *that* and premise (4) that
> we cannot make our own choices. Finally, it follows from *that* and premise
> (3) that we are not free. So, from the assumption that God exists, it
> follows that we are not free. QED.

The basic structure of this "proof" is the same as the structure of our proof
about the old lady who swallowed a fly. We *assume* the antecedent, and
*reason to* the consequent. In this way we establish that *if* the antecedent
is true, *then* the consequent must be true too. In other words, in this way,
we prove the conditional.

Here is our proof, formally laid out:

::: proof
1.  [If God exists, we are not free.]{.show}
2.  [God exists. [AS]{.just}]{.indent}
3.  [If She exists, then She controls everything. [PR]{.just}]{.indent}
4.  [She controls everything. [MP 2,3]{.just}]{.indent}
5.  [If She controls everything, then everything that happens is part of Her
    plan. [PR]{.just}]{.indent}
6.  [Everything that happens is part of Her plan. [MP 4,5]{.just}]{.indent}
7.  [If everything that happens is part of Her plan, then we cannot make our
    own choices. [PR]{.just}]{.indent}
8.  [We cannot make our own choices. [MP 6,7]{.just}]{.indent}
9.  [We are free only if we can make our own choices. [PR]{.just}]{.indent}
10. [We are not free. [MT 8,9]{.just}]{.indent}
11. [:CD 10]{.qed}
:::

To see how this plays out as a derivation in SL,
 we first need to translate the argument.

:::::: wrapper

| Q: God controls everything.
| R: Everything that happens is part of God's plan.

This pattern of thought---
 temporarily assume something is true,
 in order to reason out what would follow---
 is quite common.
Think about what it is like to play tic-tac-toe.
Suppose you are X, and it is your turn:

:::illustration
![Tic Tac
Toe](https://carnap.io/static/img/tictactoe.svg){style="max-width:5em"}
:::


```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
12 What's your next move?
```

::::{.reaction .correct ex=12}

Think about your thought process,
 as you figured out your next move.
You likely imagined several different possible moves.
Maybe your interior monologue went something like this:

> *Suppose I play the top left square. Then I'd be able to win on my next
> turn, by playing the middle left square. But I would never get a chance,
> because O would play the center square, and win before I got the chance.*
>
> *Oh! Suppose I play the middle square. Then O can't win on the next play.
> Instead, O will have to play in the top right corner to block me. But then I
> can still win by playing the top left corner. Oh! Either way, I will win if
> I play the middle square.*

If that is the sort of thinking you were engaging in,
 then you are already quite familiar with proving hypotheticals, like:

:::example
-   If I play the top left square, then I will lose.
-   If I play the middle square, then I will win.
:::

The pattern you use to convince yourself of these conditionals just is what we are calling Conditional Derivation.

::::

Once you attend to it, you will discover that you engage in this form of
reasoning *all the time*:

> It's late, and you're tired, you consider going to bed without brushing your
> teeth. But you imagine what would happen if you did that, shudder in disgust
> at future nasty morning breath, and go ahead and brush your teeth.

> You have $10, and you're hungry, and you are at Chipotle. You consider
> ordering the $8 steak burrito. Suppose you do. That will leave only $2. So
> if you order a steak burrito, you can't also order a coke. So you consider
> ordering a $7 chicken burrito instead. That will leave you with enough for
> the drink, so that's what you do.


More abstractly, here is the form of a conditional derivation:

::::liveshapes
:::{.proof  .compact}

1.  [[]{.P} → []{.Q}]{.show}
2.  [[]{.P} [AS]{.just}]{.indent .ellipsis}
<!-- -->
m.  [[]{.Q} [??]{.just}]{.indent}
n.  [:CD m]{.qed}

:::

We can only use CD to prove conditionals.
So the show line must be a conditional:
 []{.P} → []{.Q}. 
We then assume the *antecedent* of the show line,
 []{.P}.
Our goal is then to find a way to derive the
consequent, []{.Q}.
Our QED line cites the line where we accomplish that goal.

::::

One common mistake is to assume the *consequent*, and try to prove the
*antecedent*.
But that's ass-backwards.
The idea behind CD is to try to prove *vertically*, from top to bottom, what
your show line says *horizontally*, from left to right.

## Some Sample Derivations

As you try to construct Conditional Derivations on your own,
 you should be aware of two quirks in Carnap's behavior.

1.  Carnap lets you assume *anything*, and does not indicate an error.
    
Or, rather, Carnap does not indicate an error until *the very end*, when you
try to complete the derivation.
If you try to complete a derivation with ':CD',
 and you assumed something other than the antecedent of your show line,
 Carnap will indicate an error *to the right of your show line*.

2.  Carnap doesn't enforce a sharp distinction between premises and
    assumptions. 

In *some* cases, you might get away with using ':AS' where you should be using
':PR', or vice versa. Don't do this! It is a confusion: premises and
assumptions play two very different roles in a derivation. Also, in *many*
cases, it won't work.

## Indirect Derivations

[People sometimes say]{.newthought} that it is impossible to prove a negative.
But that's not true. In fact, or method for proving negations, Indirect
Derivation (ID), is our most powerful method of derivation.

Here is a video mini-lecture:

:::solution

::: youtube
<https://youtu.be/ZLGKNXXYFMM>
:::

:::

Euclid, the Greek mathematician,
 was able to *prove* that there is no greatest prime number.
Think about that for a moment:
 he couldn't *check* all the numbers,
 to see if the prime numbers run out at some point.
So how did he do it?

In very broad outline, this is what he did:

-   He *assumed*, for the sake of argument, that there *was* a greatest prime
    number.
-   He demonstrated that a *contradiction* followed from this assumption.

A [contradiction]{.vocab} is a pair of sentences, one the negation of the other.
For example:
 'He loves me' and 'He loves me not' are, together, a contradiction.
Whenever we have a contradiction, we can be certain that *one* of the two
sentences is true, and the other is false:

::: itt
   He loves me    He loves me not  
  -------------- ------------------ 
        T                F          
        F                T          
:::

So, returning to Euclid. 

He wanted to prove that it is *false* that there is a greatest prime number.
So, perversely, he *assumed* that it was *true*.
He then demonstrated, by valid reasoning, that from this assumption a
contradiction followed. Remember, *valid reasoning preserves truth*.
And remember, whenever we have a contradiction, we know that *one* of the two sentences
is *false*. So he reasoned from his assumption, in a way that preserves truth,
to a false conclusion. There is only one way this can be: he must have been
reasoning from a false assumption. QED.

Here is another example, also drawn from Ancient Greece.
In Plato's dialogue *Euthyphro*, two characters, Socrates and Euthyphro,
discuss the nature and definition of *piety*.

::: aside 
This passage is from *Euthyphro* 7a-8a. A [free but not great translation is
here](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/euthyfro.html). Much better (but not free)
translations can be found in any of several collections of Plato's work
published by Hackett.
:::

> Euthyphro: What is loved by the gods is pious, and what is not loved
> by the gods is impious.
>
> Socrates: Haven't we also said that the gods quarrel and differ with
> one another, and that there's mutual hostility among them?
>
> Euthyphro: Indeed, we did say that.
>
> Socrates: Then the same things, it seems, are both hated and loved by
> the gods.
> 
> Euthyphro: It seems that way.
>
> Socrates: So, on your account, Euthyphro, the same things would be
> both pious and impious.
>
> Euthyphro: Apparently.

Do you see the structure of Socrates's reasoning?
Note his use of the phrase "So, on your account, Euthyprho...":
 he seeks to undermine Euthyphro's proposal by *assuming that it is true*,
 and showing that it leads to a contradiction.
When people argue with each other,
 this is a very common pattern of reasoning:
 "Your view *can't* be right, because *if it were*...."

Consider this short and sweet argument:

:::standardform
1.   You are damned if you do.
2.   You are damned if you don't.
3.   You are damned.
:::

How do we *prove* that this conclusion follows from these premises?

Here is an informal proof:

> Suppose you aren't damned. From that and premise (1), it follows that you
> don't. But from *that* and premise (2), it follows that you are damned.
> Contradiction! So our assumption is false: you are damned after all.

Here is the same proof, presented more formally:

::: proof
1.  [You are damned.]{.show}
2.  [You are not damned. [AS]{.just}]{.indent}
3.  [You are damned if you do. [PR]{.just}]{.indent}
4.  [You don't. [MT 2,3]{.just}]{.indent}
5.  [You are damned if you don't. [PR]{.just}]{.indent}
6.  [You are damned. [MP 4,5]{.just}]{.indent}
7.  [:ID 2,6]{.qed}
:::

Do you see how it works? Let me walk you through it step by step:

-   You want to show that you are damned, so, on line (2), you assume the
    opposite of that---that you are *not* damned.
-   On lines (3) to (6), you reason out some consequences that follow from
    that assumption (and your premises)
-   But that leads you to a contradiction: lines (2) and (7) are a pair of
    sentences, one the negation of the other.

A contradiction cannot be true! So something went wrong. But your reasoning
was valid, and your premises are given, so the problem must be that your
assumption is false:

-   On line (7), you declare your victory, citing the two lines that contain
    the contradiction.

Let's put the argument into SL,
 and see what this looks like as a derivation.

Here is the argument in SL:

we derive a slight variant of this argument,
replacing the conclusion with its double negation:

m.  [[]{.Q} [??]{.just}]{.indent}
n.  [[¬[]{.Q}]{.dummy} [??]{.just}]{.indent}
n.  [:ID m,n]{.qed}

:::
:::

Note that, in this form, the show line is a *negation*,
 and our assumption is the sentence it negates.
Somewhat arbitrarily, this is the *only* form of ID
 we allow ourselves.
As a consequence, if your show line is **not a negation** then you **cannot
prove it by ID**. This is not allowed:

:::{.proof  .compact .xed}

1.  [[]{.P}]{.show}
2.  [¬[]{.P} [AS]{.just}]{.indent .ellipsis}
<!-- -->
m.  [[]{.Q} [??]{.just}]{.indent}
n.  [[¬[]{.Q}]{.dummy} [??]{.just}]{.indent}
n.  [:ID m,n]{.qed}

:::

This is why, in the example above, 
 we had to switch out our original conclusion, 
 'Q: I am damned', for its double negation, 
 '¬¬Q: I am not not damned'.

Also note that the contradiction can be **any two sentences**, []{.Q} and
¬[]{.Q}. You do not need to derive a contradiction *with your assumption*,
[]{.P}. You *can* do that, but it is not required: *any contradiction will
do*.

One last note: contradictions are funny things. Once you've
found one, you'll likely find a lot more. Your task, when constructing an ID,
isn't to find *the* contradiction; it's to find *a* contradiction.

## Subderivations


:::solution
::: youtube
<https://youtu.be/2V1Y9aubwkU>
:::
:::

[A subderivation]{.NewThought} is a derivation *inside* another derivation.
Sometimes, the only way to complete a derivation is by constructing one or
more subderivations inside it.

Consider this form of argument:

::: standardform
-   P → (Q → R)
-   S → Q
-   P → (S → R)
:::

Or, in English:

::: standardform
1.   If you go, then (if you have a good time, then you will be glad you went)
2.   If it's a good party, then you will have a good time.
3.   If you go, then (if it's a good party, then you will be glad you went)
:::

Maybe you are trying to decide whether or not to go to a party.
Like a tic-tac-toe player reasoning out their next move,
 you are considering the possibilities. Imagine your interior monologue goes
 something like this:

> Assume, for the sake of argument, that I go. Maybe it'll be a good party,
> but maybe it won't. Assume, for the sake of argument, that it is a good
> party. Then I'll have a good time. And, if I have a good time, I'll be glad
> I went.
>
> So, I still don't know if I should go, and I still don't know if it will be
> a good party. But I do know this: *if* I go, then *if* it is a good party,
> then I'll have a good time.

Here is what the form of reasoning looks like,
 presented as a derivation in SL:

```{.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
Example P->(Q->R), S->Q :|-: P->(S->R)
|1.Show P->(S->R)
|2.   P         :AS
|3.   P->(Q->R) :PR
|4.   Q->R      :MP 2,3
|5.   S->Q      :PR
|6.   Show S->R
|7.     S       :AS
|8.     Q       :MP 5,7
|9.     R       :MP 8,4
|10.   :CD 9
|11.:CD 6 
```

That's alot! Before getting lost in the details, notice the basic structure:
 we have a derivation *inside* of our derivation. It is a conditional
 derivation, and it starts with the show line on line (6) and
 ends with the QED line on line (10).

Let's walk through the construction of this derivation a few steps at a time.
First, we notice that our conclusion is a conditional, and so set up a
conditional derivation:

```{.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
Example P->(Q->R), S->Q :|-: P->(S->R)
|1.Show P->(S->R)
|2.  P         :AS
```

Next, we start bringing down the premises, looking for opportunities to apply
our rules:

```{.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
Example P->(Q->R), S->Q :|-: P->(S->R)
|1.Show P->(S->R)
|2.   P         :AS
|3.   P->(Q->R) :PR
|4.   Q->R      :MP 2,3
|5.   S->Q      :PR
```

At this point, we are stuck. 
We can't apply MP or MT with what we have. 
Applying DNI or DNE isn't going to get us anywhere.

The first trick to becoming unstuck is to figure out what we need to *get*.
Forget, for the moment, about lines (2)-(5), and trying to apply our rules.
Look back up at line (1).
We are trying to prove a conditional.
We assumed its antecedent on line (2).
So *what we need to get* is its consequent, 'S → R'.

The second trick to becoming unstuck is this: when you see what you need to
get, but there is no obvious way to get it, enter a new show line for it.

```{.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
Example P->(Q->R), S->Q :|-: P->(S->R)
|1.Show P->(S->R)
|2.  P         :AS
|3.  P->(Q->R) :PR
|4.  Q->R      :MP 2,3
|5.  S->Q      :PR
|6.  Show S->R
```

Once again, we find ourselves trying to prove a conditional. But this time,
the conditional is 'S → R', instead of 'P → (S → R)'. We prove conditionals
using CD:

```{.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
Example P->(Q->R), S->Q :|-: P->(S->R)
|1.Show P->(S->R)
|2.   P         :AS
|3.   P->(Q->R) :PR
|4.   Q->R      :MP 2,3
|5.   S->Q      :PR
|6.   Show S->R
|7.     S       :AS
```

See what I've done? I assumed 'S', because it is the antecedent of my show
line on line (6). And I've indented that 'S', so that it is *under* the show
line on line (6). Carnap obliges me by starting a second vertical *scope*
line, to indicate that I am now working on the subderivation.

My new assumption, 'S', unlocks the possibility of applying MP a few times.
So that's what I do, and before long, I have managed to derive 'R':

```{.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
Example P->(Q->R), S->Q :|-: P->(S->R)
|1.Show P->(S->R)
|2.   P         :AS
|3.   P->(Q->R) :PR
|4.   Q->R      :MP 2,3
|5.   S->Q      :PR
|6.   Show S->R
|7.     S       :AS
|8.     Q       :MP 5,7
|9.     R       :MP 8,4
```

I now have, on line (9), the consequent of the conditional on my show line,
line (6). So I have completed my subderivation. To indicate this, I enter a
QED line, citing line (9). And I out-dent my QED line, so it is aligned with
the show line that began my subderivation:

```{.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
Example P->(Q->R), S->Q :|-: P->(S->R)
|1.Show P->(S->R)
|2.   P         :AS
|3.   P->(Q->R) :PR
|4.   Q->R      :MP 2,3
|5.   S->Q      :PR
|6.   Show S->R
|7.     S       :AS
|8.     Q       :MP 5,7
|9.     R       :MP 8,4
|10.   :CD 9
```

When you complete a subderivation, two things happen at the same time.
First, everything that happened *inside* that subderivation is closed off, and
no longer available.
But, second, your show line now becomes available: you have no *proven* 'S →
R', so you are now entitled to *use* it, just like any other available line in your
derivation.

In this case, line (6) was what we needed to complete our derivation. So we
are done. A quick QED line, citing line (6), finishes the derivation off:

```{.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
Example P->(Q->R), S->Q :|-: P->(S->R)
|1.Show P->(S->R)
|2.   P         :AS
|3.   P->(Q->R) :PR
|4.   Q->R      :MP 2,3
|5.   S->Q      :PR
|6.   Show S->R
|7.     S       :AS
|8.     Q       :MP 5,7
|9.     R       :MP 8,4
|10.   :CD 9
|11.:CD 6 
```

A QED line *unlocks* a show line. When we first wrote down line (6), it was a
statement of intention, a goal we were setting for ourselves: to prove S → R.
But on line (10), we succeeded at achieving that goal; we had proved S → R; we
unlocked the show line. So, on line (11), we were free to use that show line.

To make this more precise, we introduce the concept of an [available
line]{.vocab}. An available line is a line that you are allowed to
use. As we progress through a derivation, some lines that weren't available
become available, and some lines that were available stop being available.

Specifically,

-   A show line is *unavailable* until it has been *shown*.
-   Lines inside a subderivation are only available within that subderivation.
    They are not available once the subderivation is completed.

Before line (10), we were not allowed to *use* line (6). And, in general, you
cannot *use* a show line that has not yet been *shown*. This, for example, is
not allowed:

```{.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
Example P->(Q->R), S->Q :|-: P->(S->R)
|1.Show P->(S->R)
|2.   P         :AS
|3.   S->R      :MP 1,2
|4.:CD 3
```

Do you see the mistake? We acted as though our show line was available for
use, and applied MP to it. But that's not allowed, because the show line is
not available.

Here is another example of what is not allowed:

```{.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" submission=none}
Example P->Q :|-: Q
|1.Show Q
|2.   P->Q      :PR
|3.   Show P->Q 
|4.     P       :AS
|5.     Q       :MP 2,5
|6.   :CD 5
|7.   Q         :MP 2,4
|4.:DD 7 
```

Here the error is on line (7), where I try to *use* line (4), even though (4)
is no longer available, because it is inside a completed subderivation.

We have this restriction, because a line within a subderivation might be an
assumption, or depend on an assumption, that was only meant to be temporary,
for the sake of argument, and should not be exported outside of the
subderivation. 



## Unlocking the Power of ID

Recall our argument,

:::standardform
-   You are damned if you do.
-   You are damned if you don't.
-   You are damned.
:::

We couldn't use ID to derive this conclusion from these premises, because the
conclusion is not a negation, and the only form of ID we allow ourselves is
one that requires our conclusion to be a negation. So, instead, we used ID to derive its double
negation:

:::standardform
-   You are damned if you do.
-   You are damned if you don't.
-   You are not not damned.
:::

With subderivations, we can get past this restriction. See if you can work out
the trick for yourself. If you can't, no worries! Watch the video.

## Theorems

Sometimes, a derivation has no premises.

How is that even possible?
How can an argument with no premises be valid? 
Recall the definition of validity: 

-   An argument is valid iff it is impossible for the premises to be true and
    the conclusion false.

When an argument has no premises, the definition can be simplified:

-   An argument *with no premises* is valid iff it is impossible *for the
    conclusion to be false*.

So if a derivation has no premises, that means that its conclusion is a
sentence that *cannot be false*, a *necessary truth*.
More specifically, it means that it is a *logical truth*, a sentence whose
truth can be settled by logic alone.

When a sentence can be derived from no premises, we call it a
[theorem]{.vocab}.
Practically speaking, deriving
a theorem is no different than completing any other derivation. Since you
don't have any premises to work with, you will need to use CD or ID, either
for the main derivation, or as a subderivation. These will give you
assumptions that you can reason from.

Carnap indicates the lack of premises with the symbol '⊤', called "Top". Don't
mistake this for a funny looking 'T'!

:::

When you complete the derivation of a theorem, you should stop and
think about it. Why is this sentence a logical truth? What about its form
guarantees that it must be true? In this case, think of it like this: if P is
true, then if Q is also true then P is still true. For example, "If it rains,
then it rains if I don't bring my umbrella."
