# Truth Tables for Sentences: Supplementary Exercises

## Reading Truth Tables

It can be hard to read truth tables. At first glance, you just see a sentence
in SL, and, below it, a bunch of Ts and Fs. So let's quickly review how to
read a table.

First, to the left of the vertical line, we have one column for each sentence
letter contained in the sentence we want to analyze. And under each sentence
letter, we have a column of truth values. These will always be arranged in the
same combinatorial pattern. In the right-most column, the sentence letter will
be assigned alternating Ts and Fs. In the second-from-the-right column, it will be two
Ts, followed by two Fs, followed by two Ts, ... And in the
third-from-the-right column, four Ts, then four Fs, then four Ts, ... And so
on, for however many columns are needed. The most important things to
understand are these:

-   Each row represents a possible assignment of truth values to the sentence
    letters.
-   Taken together, these rows represent *all possible* assignments of truth values
     to the sentence letters.

To the right of the vertical line we have the sentence we want to analyze.
And under each sentence letter and connective in that sentence, there is a
column of truth values. What do these mean?

-   The truth value under each sentence letter represents the truth value of that sentence letter.
-   The truth value under each connective represents the truth value of the part of the sentence for which that connective is the main connective. 
-   The truth value under the main connective represents the truth value of the whole sentence.

With this in mind, here are some tables for you to practice reading:

```{.TruthTable .Simple options="nocounterexample immutable nocheck display" submission=none}
  ~(~P/\Q)
| T FTF T 
| T FTF F 
| F TFT T 
| T TFF F 
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection submission=none options=check}
1 According to this table, the sentence '¬(¬P∧Q)' is true when:
| *P and Q are both true
| *P is true and Q is false
| P is false and Q is true
| *P is false and Q is false
```

```{.TruthTable .Simple options="nocounterexample immutable nocheck display" submission=none}
  ~P->(Q<->P)
| FTT  T T T 
| FTF  F F T 
| TFT  T F F 
| TFT  F T F 
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection submission=none options=check}
2 According to this table, the whole sentence is false when:
| P and Q are both true
| *P is true and Q is false
| P is false and Q is true
| P is false and Q is false
```

```{.TruthTable .Simple options="nocounterexample immutable nocheck display" submission=none}
  ~Q/\R->~(P\/Q)
| FTF TT F TT T
| FTF FT F TT T
| TFT TF F TT F
| TFF FT F TT F
| FTF TT F FT T
| FTF FT F FT T
| TFT TT T FF F
| TFF FT T FF F
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection submission=none options=check}
3 According to this table, '¬(P∨Q)' is true when:
| P, Q and R are all true
| *P, Q, and R are all false
| P is true, Q is false, and R is true
| *P and Q are false, but R is true
| This table cannot be used to answer this question
4 According to this table, the whole sentence is false when:
| P, Q and R are all true
| P and Q are true, but R is false
| *P and R are true, but Q is is false
| Q and R are true, but P is false
| This table cannot be used to answer this question
5 According to this table, 'Q∧R' is true when:
| Q, P, and R are all true
| Q is false and P and R are true
| Q and P are false and R is true
| Q, P, and R are all false
| *This table cannot be used to answer this question
```

# Calculating Truth

Sometimes, calculating an entire truth table can be daunting. Build
confidence by calculating each row, one at a time, and checking your results
as you go:

```{.TruthTable .Partial options="strictGivens nocounterexample" submission=none}
6 P,Q,R: ~(P<->R)\/(Q->P)
|    T T T  - - - - -  - --
7 P,Q,R: ~(P<->R)\/(Q->P)
|    T T F  - - - - -  - --
8 P,Q,R: ~(P<->R)\/(Q->P)
|    T F T  - - - - -  - --
9 P,Q,R: ~(P<->R)\/(Q->P)
|    T F F  - - - - -  - --
10 P,Q,R: ~(P<->R)\/(Q->P)
|    F T T  - - - - -  - --
11 P,Q,R: ~(P<->R)\/(Q->P)
|    F T F  - - - - -  - --
12 P,Q,R: ~(P<->R)\/(Q->P)
|    F F T  - - - - -  - --
13 P,Q,R: ~(P<->R)\/(Q->P)
|    F F F  - - - - -  - --
```

```{.TruthTable .Partial options="strictGivens nocounterexample" submission=none}
14 P,Q,R: ~P->(~Q\/~(P<->R))
|    T T T  - -  -- -- - - -
15 P,Q,R: ~P->(~Q\/~(P<->R))
|    T T F  - -  -- -- - - -
16 P,Q,R: ~P->(~Q\/~(P<->R))
|    T F T  - -  -- -- - - -
17 P,Q,R: ~P->(~Q\/~(P<->R))
|    T F F  - -  -- -- - - -
15 P,Q,R: ~P->(~Q\/~(P<->R))
|    F T T  - -  -- -- - - -
16 P,Q,R: ~P->(~Q\/~(P<->R))
|    F T F  - -  -- -- - - -
17 P,Q,R: ~P->(~Q\/~(P<->R))
|    F F T  - -  -- -- - - -
18 P,Q,R: ~P->(~Q\/~(P<->R))
|    F F F  - -  -- -- - - -
```

```{.TruthTable .Partial options="strictGivens nocounterexample" submission=none}
19 P,Q,R: ~~(~P->~(~Q->R))
|    T T T   -- -- -- -- --
20 P,Q,R: ~~(~P->~(~Q->R))
|    T T F   -- -- -- -- --
21 P,Q,R: ~~(~P->~(~Q->R))
|    T F T   -- -- -- -- --
22 P,Q,R: ~~(~P->~(~Q->R))
|    T F F   -- -- -- -- --
23 P,Q,R: ~~(~P->~(~Q->R))
|    F T T   -- -- -- -- --
24 P,Q,R: ~~(~P->~(~Q->R))
|    F T F   -- -- -- -- --
25 P,Q,R: ~~(~P->~(~Q->R))
|    F F T   -- -- -- -- --
26 P,Q,R: ~~(~P->~(~Q->R))
|    F F F   -- -- -- -- --
