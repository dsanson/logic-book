# Truth Tables for Arguments: Supplementary Exercises

These are supplementary exercises, for those seeking more practice with truth
tables before taking (or retaking) the unit test. These are not *required*,
and are not *worth any points*.

## Characteristic Truth Table Drills

These are simple truth tables, meant to help those who are struggling to
remember how to apply the characteristic truth tables.

```{.TruthTable .Partial options="nocounterexample strictGivens" submission=none}
1 P/\Q
|    T -T
2 S->U
|    T -F
3 P\/Q
|    F -T
4 Q/\P
|    F -F
5 P->Q
|    F -T
6 S<->U
|    F - T
7 P\/P
|    T -T
8 P<->Q
|    F - F
9 Q\/R
|    T -F
10 Q->P
|    F -F
11 R/\P
|    F -T
12 R\/Q
|    F -F
13 Q<->P
|    T - T
14 P<->Q
|    T - F
15 Q\/Q
|    F -F
16 R<->S
|    F - F
17 Q/\P
|    T -T
18 R\/S
|    F -T
19 P->Q
|    T -F
20 P/\Q
|    F -F
21 Q->R
|     T F-
22 P\/P
|     T --
23 Q\/R
|     - F-
24 P/\Q
|     - T-
25 P->Q
|     - F-
27 R<->Q
|     - - F
```

## Finding the Right Truth Value

One of the challenges, when completing truth tables, is knowing which truth
value you are supposed to look at in order to calculate the truth value of a
given part of the sentence. Here are some drills meant to help you work on
this skill.

```{.TruthTable .Partial options="nocounterexample strictGivens" submission=none}
28 ~(P->Q)
|     - FTF
29 ~P->Q
|     TF-F
30 ~(P\/Q)
|     - F TT
31 ~P\/~Q
|     FT -FT
32 ~(P/\Q)->(~Q\/~R)
|     F T TT -  FT FFT
33 P\/Q\/(R->P)
|     T TF - FTT
34 P\/(Q\/(R->P))
|     F-  F T FT F
35 ~(~(P<->Q/\R)->~P)
|     - F F T T FF T TF
36 ~(Q/\P/\R/\S/\T/\U)
|     - T TT TT TT TT FF
37 ~(Q/\P)/\~(R/\S)
|     F TTT  - T T FF
```

## Spot the Errors

It is easy to make mistakes when completing a truth table. (Computers are
really good at this! Humans, not so much. Making mistakes on truth tables
reveals your humanity.) When you make a mistake, Carnap will tell you that
something is wrong, but it won't tell you *what* is wrong. You have to find
the mistake yourself. (This is true on the *test* too.) So here are some truth
tables with mistakes. Your job is to find and fix the mistakes.

```{.TruthTable .Simple options="nocounterexample" submission=none}
38 ~(P->Q)
|     F TT T
|     F TF F
|     T FT T
|     T FF F
39 P/\Q->R
|     T TT FF
|     T TT TT
|     T FF FT
|     T FF TF
|     F FT FT
|     F FT TF
|     F TF FT
|     F TF FF
40 ~(P/\Q)<->~Q\/~P
|     F T TT  T FT FFT
|     F T TF  T FF FFT
|     T F FT  F FT FFT
|     F F TF  F TF TTF
```

```{.TruthTable .Validity options="nocounterexample turnstilemark" submission=none}
41 P->Q, Q\/P :|-: Q
|     T TT  T TT  T   T
|     T TF  F TT  F   F
|     F TT  T TF  F   T
|     F TF  F FF  T   F
42 P\/Q, ~P :|-: Q
|     TTT   FT  F   T
|     TTF   FT  F   F
|     FTT   TF  T   T
|     FFF   TF  F   F
```

## Understanding the Tests

We use truth tables to test for truth-functional truth, truth-functional
falsehood, truth-functional contingency, truth-functional equivalence, truth-functional consistency, and
truth-functional validity. It is easy to get wrapped up in the challenge of
calculating the tables correctly, and lose site of what the tables show. Here
are several problems where the truth table has been completed for you, and
your task is to figure out what it shows.

These open-ended short answer questions are meant to encourage you to try to
put you reasoning into words. This will help solidify your understanding of
the tests. The multiple choice questions allow you to check your answers,
though they do not allow you to check whether or not your reasoning in support
of that answer was correct.
