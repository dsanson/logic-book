# Translation in SL, continued: Supplements

These are supplemental exercises. They are not for credit, and are not worth
any points. But they are a way to get more practice.

## 'if', 'only if', and 'if and only if'

'if', 'only if', and 'if and only if' are not new in this chapter.
But they are one of the easiest things to mess up from Chapter 4.
So let's start with review of that:

(There is no "check" button. But you can hit "enter" or "return", as usual, to
check your answer.)

``` {.Translate .Prop options="check" submission=none}
1 P->Q:  Q if P
2 P->Q:  if P Q
3 P->Q:  P only if Q
4 P<->Q: P if and only if Q
5 R->Q:  R only if Q
6 Q->S:  S if Q
7 T->Q:  if T Q
8 T<->R: T if and only if R
9 S->Q:  S only if Q
10 S->Q: Only if Q, S
11 R->Q: Q if R
12 P->S: P only if S
```

## Stylistic Variants Drills

Again, this is review from Chapter 4.

``` {.Translate .Prop submission=none}
13 P->Q:    Provided that P, Q
14 P->Q:    P only on the condition that Q
15 P/\~Q:   P but not Q
16 P\/Q:    P unless Q
17 Q->P:    P if Q
18 P<->Q:   P just in case Q
19 Q<->P:   Q if and only if P
20 R/\S:    R and S
21 S\/Q:    Unless S, Q
22 P/\R:    P even though R
23 R->Q:    Q only on the assumption that R
24 R<->Q:   R just in case Q
25 ~(P\/Q): Neither P nor Q
26 ~Q/\P:   not Q, but P
27 P->Q:    Only if Q, P
28 P->Q:    Q if P
29 S->R:    Assuming R, S
30 ~(R\/S): Neither R nor S
31 Q/\S:    Q but S
32 Q\/S:    Q unless S
33 Q->R:    R on the assumption that Q
34 P<->Q:   P provided that and only provided that Q
35 Q/\S:    Q but S
```

## Comma Rule Drills

Commas indicate the bigger break!

``` {.Translate .Prop submission=none}
36 (P/\Q)\/R:        P and Q, or R
37 P/\(Q\/R):        P, and Q or R
38 R->(Q->P):        P if Q, if R
39 P->(Q/\R):        P, only if Q and R
40 (P->Q)/\R:        Q if P, but R
41 (Q->P)\/(R/\~S):  Unless P if Q, R but not S
42 R->(Q->P):        P provided that Q, assuming R
43 Q->(Q->P):        Q, only provided that P if Q
44 (P<->Q)\/~(R\/S): P just in case Q, unless neither R nor S
```

## Compound Subjects and Predicates

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| P: I like dollars
| Q: I like diamonds
| R: I like stunting
| S: I like shining
| T: You like dollars
| U: You like diamonds
| V: You like stunting
| W: You like shining
:::

``` {.Translate .Prop submission=none}
42 T/\P : You and I like dollars
43 V/\R->U\/Q : If you and I like stunting, then you or I like diamonds
44 P/\Q /\ ~(R\/S) : I like dollars and diamonds but I don't like stunting or shining.
45 V/\R\/~V : You and I like stunting unless you don't like stunting.
46 Q/\P<->V/\W : I like diamonds and dollars just in case you like stunting and shining.
47 Q/\S->V/\T : I like diamonds and shining only provided that you like stunting and dollars
48 V/\T->Q/\S : I like diamonds and shining provided that you like stunting and dollars
49 V/\T<->Q/\S : I like diamonds and shining just in case you like stunting and dollars
50 ~(Q\/U)/\(P\/T) : Neither of us likes diamonds but one of us likes dollars

## Quantification

:::soasticky
| P: Jada attends ISU
| Q: Luke attends ISU
| R: Terrell attends ISU

We are Jada, Luke, and Terrell
:::

Suppose we are Jada, Luke, and Terrell.

``` {.Translate .Prop submission=none}
51 P/\Q/\R : All of us attend ISU
52 P\/Q\/R : At least one of us attends ISU
53 P\/Q\/R : Some of us attend ISU
54 ~(P/\Q/\R) : Not all of us attend ISU 
56 ~(P\/Q) : Neither Jada nor Luke attend ISU
55 ~(P\/Q\/R) : None of attend ISU
57 P\/Q\/R->P/\Q/\R : All of us attend ISU if any of us attend ISU
58 ~(P\/Q\/R)\/R : None of us attend ISU unless Terrell does
```
