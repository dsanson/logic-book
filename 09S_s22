# Translation in SL, continued: Supplements

These are supplemental exercises. They are not for credit, and are not worth
any points. But they are a great way to get more practice!

In the Reading, Exercises, and Mastery Check, we focus on going all the way
from English to SL. But it might be useful to just focus on the hardest step:
figuring out how to translate the connectives.

## 'if', 'only if', and 'if and only if' Drills

First, some drills on 'if' vs. 'only if' vs. 'if and only if'

There is no "check" button. But you can hit "enter" or "return", as usual, to
check your answer.

``` {.Translate .Prop options="check" submission=none}
S9.1 P->Q:  Q if P
S9.2 P->Q:  if P Q
S9.3 P->Q:  P only if Q
S9.4 P<->Q: P if and only if Q
S9.5 R->Q:  R only if Q
S9.6 Q->S:  S if Q
S9.7 T->Q:  if T Q
S9.8 T<->R: T if and only if R
S9.9 S->Q:  S only if Q
S9.10 S->Q: Only if Q, S
S9.11 R->Q: Q if R
S9.12 P->S: P only if S
```

## Stylistic Variants Drills

Second, some drills on stylistic variants of our connectives.

``` {.Translate .Prop submission=none}
S9.13 P->Q:    Provided that P, Q
S9.14 P->Q:    P only on the condition that Q
S9.15 P/\~Q:   P but not Q
S9.16 P\/Q:    P unless Q
S9.17 Q->P:    P if Q
S9.18 P<->Q:   P just in case Q
S9.19 Q<->P:   Q if and only if P
S9.20 R/\S:    R and S
S9.21 S\/Q:    Unless S, Q
S9.22 P/\R:    P even though R
S9.23 R->Q:    Q only on the assumption that R
S9.24 R<->Q:   R just in case Q
S9.25 ~(P\/Q): Neither P nor Q
S9.26 ~Q/\P:   not Q, but P
S9.27 P->Q:    Only if Q, P
S9.28 P->Q:    Q if P
S9.29 S->R:    Assuming R, S
S9.30 ~(R\/S): Neither R nor S
S9.31 Q/\S:    Q but S
S9.32 Q\/S:    Q unless S
S9.33 Q->R:    R on the assumption that Q
S9.34 P<->Q:   P provided that and only provided that Q
S9.35 Q/\S:    Q but S
```

## Comma Rule Drills

Commas indicate the bigger break!

``` {.Translate .Prop submission=none}
S6.36 (P/\Q)\/R:        P and Q, or R
S6.37 P/\(Q\/R):        P, and Q or R
S6.38 R->(Q->P):        P if Q, if R
S6.39 P->(Q/\R):        P, only if Q and R
S6.40 (P->Q)/\R:        Q if P, but R
S6.41 (Q->P)\/(R/\~S):  Unless P if Q, R but not S
S6.42 R->(Q->P):        P provided that Q, assuming R
S6.43 Q->(Q->P):        Q, only provided that P if Q
S6.44 (P<->Q)\/~(R\/S): P just in case Q, unless neither R nor S
```

| P: I like dollars
| Q: I like diamonds
| R: I like stunting
| S: I like shining
| T: You like dollars
| U: You like diamonds
| V: You like stunting
| W: You like shining
:::

``` {.Translate .Prop submission=none}
S6.42 T/\P : You and I like dollars
S6.43 V/\R->U\/Q : If you and I like stunting, then you or I like diamonds
S6.44 P/\Q /\ ~(R\/S) : I like dollars and diamonds but I don't like stunting or shining.
S6.45 V/\R\/~V : You and I like stunting unless you don't like stunting.
S6.46 Q/\P<->V/\W : I like diamonds and dollars just in case you like stunting and shining.
S6.47 Q/\S->V/\T : I like diamonds and shining only provided that you like stunting and dollars
S6.48 V/\T->Q/\S : I like diamonds and shining provided that you like stunting and dollars
S6.49 V/\T<->Q/\S : I like diamonds and shining just in case you like stunting and dollars
S6.50 ~(Q\/U)/\(P\/T) : Neither of us likes diamonds but one of us likes dollars

We are Jada, Luke, and Terrell

Suppose we are Jada, Luke, and Terrell.

``` {.Translate .Prop submission=none}
S6.51 P/\Q/\R : All of us attend ISU
S6.52 P\/Q\/R : At least one of us attends ISU
S6.53 P\/Q\/R : Some of us attend ISU
S6.54 ~(P/\Q/\R) : Not all of us attend ISU 
S6.56 ~(P\/Q) : Neither Jada nor Luke attend ISU
S6.55 ~(P\/Q\/R) : None of attend ISU
S6.57 P\/Q\/R->P/\Q/\R : All of us attend ISU if any of us attend ISU
S6.58 ~(P\/Q\/R)\/R : None of us attend ISU unless Terrell does
