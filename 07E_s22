# Truth Tables for Sentences: Exercises

**HEADS UP!**: Currently, your work on truth tables will not be saved across
page reloads, because the results were too buggy to be useful. Your
*submissions* will still be saved. But if you reload the page, any work you've
done on a truth table will be reset.

## Fix the Errors

Each of the following truth tables contains at least one mistake. Find and fix
the mistake(s).

```{.TruthTable .Simple options="nocounterexample" points=10}
1 P/\Q
|    T TT
|    T FF
|    F FT
|    T TT
2 P->Q
|    T TT
|    T FF
|    F FT
|    F FF
3 P\/Q
|    T FT
|    T TF
|    F TT
|    F FF
4 P<->Q
|    T T T
|    T F F
|    F F T
|    F F F
5 ~(P->Q)
|    F T T T
|    F T F F
|    T F T T
|    T F T F
6 ~P->Q
|    F T T T
|    F T F F
|    T F T T
|    T F T F
```

For each of the following, complete the truth table, and then answer the
associated question.

Note that on the test, error checking will be enabled for the truth tables,
since it is so easy to make a "typo". But error checking will not be enabled
for the associated multiple choice questions. Also, on the test, as here, you
will get equal points for both.


```{.TruthTable .Simple options="nocounterexample" points=10}
7 ~(P<->~P)
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
8 This is:
| *truth-functionally true
| truth-functionally false
| truth-functionally contingent
```

```{.TruthTable .Simple options="nocounterexample" points=10}
9 ~(~P/\~Q)
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
10 This is:
| truth-functionally true
| truth-functionally false
| *truth-functionally contingent
```

```{.TruthTable .Simple options="nocounterexample" points=10}
11 ~P->(Q/\P)
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
12 This is:
| truth-functionally true
| truth-functionally false
| *truth-functionally contingent
```

```{.TruthTable .Simple options="nocounterexample" points=10}
13 ~P->(Q\/~P)
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
14 This is:
| *truth-functionally true
| truth-functionally false
| truth-functionally contingent
```

```{.TruthTable .Simple options="nocounterexample" points=10}
15 (P<->Q)/\(~P<->Q)
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
16 This is:
| truth-functionally true
| *truth-functionally false
| truth-functionally contingent
```

```{.TruthTable .Simple options="nocounterexample" points=10}
17 (R<->P)->((Q/\P)<->(R/\Q))
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
18 This is:
| *truth-functionally true
| truth-functionally false
| truth-functionally contingent
```
