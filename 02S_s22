# Validity, Soundness, and Strength: Supplementary Exercises

This is a supplement. Supplements are not required, and do not figure in the
calculation of your course grade. These exercises are for students looking for
more practice.

## Definitions

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer submission=none}
1 Try to write down the definition of validity without looking it up. Then check your answer.
2 Try to write down the definition of soundness without looking it up. Then check your answer.
3 Try to write down the definition of inductive strength without looking it up. Then check your answer.
```

## Applying the Definitions

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer submission=none}
4 Come up with your own example of an argument that is sound.
5 Come up with your own example of an argument that is valid, but not sound.
6 Come up with your own example of an argument that is not valid, but is inductively strong.
7 Come up with your own example of an argument that is neither valid nor inductively strong.
8 Come up with your own example of an argument that is neither valid nor inductively strong, but has true premises and a true conclusion.
9 Come up with your own example of an argument that is valid, but has a false conclusion.
10 Come up with your own example of an argument that is not valid, but has a true conclusion.
11 Come up with your own example of an argument that is valid, even though the conclusion doesn't seem to have anything to do with the premises.
12 Come up with your own example of an argument that is valid, but has all true premises and a false conclusion.
```

## Recognizing Validity and Soundness

These exercises simply don't lend themselves to being set up as problems on
Carnap. So I give them to you as exercises to do on paper, with some answers,
hints, and comments hidden behind spoiler boxes.

For each of the following, mark each premise and conclusion as true (T), false
(F), or don't know (?). Then decide whether or not the argument is valid,
whether or not it is sound, and whether or not it is inductively strong. If
you think an argument is *invalid*, try to describe for yourself a possible
situation in which the premises are true and the conclusion is false.

::: standardform
-   If it rains, it pours.
-   It rains.
-   It pours.
:::

:::spoiler
::: standardform
-   False: If it rains, it pours.
-   ?: It rains.
-   ?: It pours.
:::

The first premise is false. Sometimes, when it rains, it just sprinkles. 

As I write this, where I am, the second premise is false too. But it might be
true where you are, as you solve this problem. The same goes for the
conclusion.

The argument is valid, but it isn't sound. It is valid because if the premises
are true, the conclusion has to be true too. It isn't sound, because at least
one of its premises is false. 
:::

::: standardform
-   If you live in Normal, you live in Illinois.
-   You live in Illinois.
-   Your live in Normal.
:::

::: spoiler
::: standardform
-   True: If you live in Normal, you live in Illinois.
-   True?: You live in Illinois.
-   ?: Your live in Normal.
:::

The first premise is true. I suspect that the second premise is true too, but
you are in a better position to know that than I am. I don't know whether or
not the conclusion is true: I know  you are a student at ISU, but you might
live in another town.

The argument is not valid. To see this, suppose you lived in Chicago: then both premises
would be true, but the conclusion is false. 

And since it is not valid, it is not sound.

Is it inductively strong? No: most people who live in Illinois do not live in
Normal. So if the only thing I knew about you was that you lived in Illinois,
and the only thing I knew about Normal was that Normal was in Illinois, that
wouldn't provide me with a good reason to think that you live in Normal.

::: standardform
| [If you live in Illinois, you live in Normal.]{.premise .nn}
| [You live in Illinois.]{.premise .nn}
| [Your live in Normal.]{.conclusion}
:::

:::spoiler

| Premise 1: False (?)
| Premise 2: True (I am guessing)
| Premise 3: ?

This argument is valid. The premises might not actually be true, but if they
*were* true, the conclusion would have to be true too.
:::

::: standardform
| [All dogs go to heaven.]{.premise .nn}
| [Fido is a dog.]{.premise .nn}
| [Fido goes to heaven.]{.conclusion}
:::

:::spoiler
This is valid. I doubt the first premise is true. I don't know who or what
Fido is, so I am not in a position to assess the truth of the second premise
or the conclusion.
:::

::: standardform
| [All dogs go to heaven.]{.premise .nn}
| [Fido goes to heaven.]{.premise .nn}
| [Fido is a dog.]{.conclusion}
:::

:::spoiler
This is not valid. Suppose all dogs and cats go to heaven, and Fido is a cat.
:::

::: standardform
| [Most dogs go to heaven.]{.premise .nn}
| [Fido goes to heaven.]{.premise .nn}
| [Fido is a dog.]{.conclusion}
:::

:::spoiler
Not valid. Suppose the premises are both true, and Fido is a cat. Also not
inductively strong. The first premise says that most dogs go to heaven, it
doesn't say that most who go to heaven are dogs. It could be that most dogs go
to heaven, and most ants go to heaven too. There are far more ants than dogs,
so in that situation, the fact that Fido goes to heaven doesn't give you much
reason to think he is a dog rather than an ant.
:::

::: standardform
| [Most dogs go to heaven.]{.premise .nn}
| [Fido is a dog.]{.premise .nn}
| [Fido goes to heaven.]{.conclusion}
:::

:::spoiler
Not valid. Fido could be an exception: one of the dogs who doesn't go to
heaven.

But the argument is inductively strong: if most dogs go to heaven, and Fido is
a dog, then, in absence of specific reasons to think that Fido is an
exception, it is a good bet that Fido is probably going to heaven.

::: standardform
| [Any book in the library is worth reading.]{.premise .nn}
| [Moby Dick is a book in the library.]{.premise .nn}
| [Moby Dick is worth reading.]{.conclusion}
:::

:::spoiler
Valid. I leave it to you to assess the actual truth or falsehood of the
premises and the conclusion.
:::

::: standardform
| [Any book in the library is worth reading.]{.premise .nn}
| [Moby Dick is worth reading.]{.premise .nn}
| [Moby Dick is a book in the library.]{.conclusion}
:::

:::spoiler
Not valid. The first premise says that all the books in the library are worth
reading. It doesn't say that all the books worth reading are in the library.
:::

::: standardform
| [There is no good evidence that the Loch Ness Monster exists.]{.premise .nn}
| [The Loch Ness Monster does not exist.]{.conclusion}
:::

:::spoiler
The premise is true, and the conclusion is true. The argument is not valid: it
is *possible* that, despite the lack of evidence, Nessie exists. But the
argument is inductively strong, I think, especially given how much effort has
gone into to trying to find such evidence over the years.
:::

::: standardform
| [There is no good evidence that the Loch Ness Monster doesn't exist.]{.premise .nn}
| [The Loch Ness Monster exists.]{.conclusion}
:::

::: spoiler
Is this one inductively strong also? Does the lack of evidence *against* the
existence of Nessie count in support of Nessie's existence?
:::


::: standardform
| [Every human action has a cause.]{.premise .nn}
| [If an action has a cause, then it isn't free.]{.premise .nn}
| [No human action is free.]{.conclusion}
:::

:::spoiler
Valid! I leave it to you to assess the truth or falsity of the premises.
:::

::: standardform
-   It is possible that your older self will have interests and values that
    your current self despises.
-   You shouldn't plan to give your money to someone who might have
    interests and values that you despise.
-   To save for the future is to plan to give your money to your older self.
-   You should not save for the future.
:::

:::spoiler
Valid! The first premise is true. The second is harder to assess: what do you
think? And the third is also hard to assess, but seems pretty plausible. But
if you agree that all three premises are true, I am afraid that working
through this supplement may lead to your eventual financial ruin.

::: standardform
| [Every physical event has a physical cause.]{.premise .nn}
| [Mental events are not physical events.]{.premise .nn}
| [No mental event has a physical cause.]{.conclusion}

Not valid! Do you see why?
:::

::: standardform
| [Every event has a physical cause.]{.premise .nn}
| [Every mental event has a physical cause.]{.conclusion}
:::

:::spoiler
Valid!
:::

::: standardform
| [Every duck is alive.]{.premise .nn}
| [Every rubber duck is alive.]{.conclusion}
:::

:::spoiler
Not valid! A rubber duck is not a duck. Maybe this means that the previous
argument was not valid, unless we add the additional implicit premise that a
mental event is an event.
