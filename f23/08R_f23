## Introduction

In [Chapter 3](03R), we introduced the project of translating between SL and
English. In this unit, we continue that project, looking at more complicated cases.

Learning objectives:

a.  I can use commas to disambiguate structurally complex sentences, and
    guide my symbolization of those sentences
b.  I can symbolize sentences with compound subjects and predicates
c.  I can symbolize sentences involving restricted quantifier phrases
    using disjunctions and conjunctions

## Natural and Artificial Language Again

In a famous essay, Nietzsche complains that "the origin of language did not
happen logically", and describes language as an "army" of metaphor,
poetry, rhetoric:

> a mobile army of metaphors,
> [metonyms](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metonymy){target="_blank"
> rel="noopener noreferrer"}, anthropomorphisms, in short a totality of human
> relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified,
> transferred, and decorated, and which after long use people think are fixed,
> canonical, and binding. ("On Truth and Lie in an Extra-moral Sense"
> [p. 6](https://archive.org/details/NietzscheOnTruthAndLie){target="_blank"
> rel="noopener noreferrer"}). <!--_-->

Given this picture of language, our project looks to be hopeless. But we carry
on. As a matter of fact, we often can, with a bit of work, tease out the
underlying logical form of expressions in natural language, and render those
forms with precision in our artificial language, SL. And one thing we know: SL
is a language whose origin is entirely logical, bound by fixed and binding
rules, devoid of poetry and rhetorically limp, and no creature of metaphor and
metonym.

## Review from Unit 03

We begin by reviewing what we learned in Unit 03. 

### Conditionals in English and SL

Quick review: 

-   Conditionals are 'if...then...' statements
-   They have two parts: the "if-part" is called the antecedent; the
    "then-part", the consequent.
-   The word 'if' in English is an antecedent-marker: it marks whatever
    sentence comes *after* it as the antecedent.
-   The word 'then' is a consequent-marker: it marks whatever sentence comes
    *after* it as the consequent.
-   'then' is a *helper word*: it works together with an 'if' that occurs
    before it. It cannot occur on its own without 'if', but 'if' can occur
    with out 'then'.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
1 The consequent of 'If we don't try then we will never succeed' is:
| We don't try
| We try
| *We will never succeed
| We will succeed
2 The antecedent of 'The bridge will fail if it is poorly designed' is:
| The bridge will fail
| The bridge will not fail
| *The bridge is poorly designed
| The bridge is not poorly designed
```
```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
3 Consider the sentence, 'Employers need to raise wages if they want more people to apply for their jobs'. Which of the following claims are true about this sentence:
| *it's a conditional
| its conditional is 'Employers need to raise wages'
| it's a conclusion
| its conclusion is 'Employers need to raise wages'
| its consequent is 'Employers want more people to apply for their jobs'
| its antecedent is 'Employers need to raise wages'
| *its consequent is 'Employers need to raise wages'
| its conditional is 'Employers want more people to apply for their jobs'
| its antepodal is 'Employers need to raise wages'
| *its antecedent is 'Employers want more people to apply for their jobs'
| it's a consequent
| its antepodal is 'Employers want more people to apply for their jobs'
| its conclusion is 'Employers want more people to apply for their jobs'
4 Consider the sentence 'If the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie then you will be badly injured.' Which of the following are true:
| *it's a conditional
| it's a conclusion
| 'You will be badly injured' is its antecedent
| it's a consequent
| 'The moon hits your eye like a pizza pie' is its consequent
| *'You will be badly injured' is its consequent
| *'The moon hits your eye like a pizza pie' is its antecedent
```

Also,

-   The phrase 'only if' is also a consequent-marker.
-   Stylistic variants of 'if' include 'provided that', 'on the condition
    that', 'given that', and so on.
-   In SL, the antecedent always goes *before* the arrow, and the consequent *after* the arrow.

```{.Translate .Prop points=10}
5   P->Q: if P then Q
6   P->Q: P only if Q
7   S->R: R if S
8   S->P: Provided that S, P
9   P->R: Only if R, P
10   P->S: P only on the condition that S
```

### Biconditionals in English and SL

Remember,

-   The phrase 'if and only if' expresses the biconditional.
-   Stylistic variants of 'if and only if' include 'just in case' and 'exactly
    on the condition that'.

```{.Translate .Prop points=10}
11 R/\S<->Q\/P: (R and S) if and only if (Q or P)
12 P<->~Q: P exactly on the condition that not Q
13 (R->Q)<->P: (R only if Q) if and only if P
14 P<->(Q->R): P just in case (if Q, R)
```

### Conjunctions in English and SL

-   'and' expresses a conjunction.
-   'both' is an optional helper word that coordinates with 'and'.
-   Stylistic variants of 'and' include 'but', 'however', 'nevertheless', and
    so on.

```{.Translate .Prop points=10}
15 P/\Q: Both P and Q
16 ~Q/\(P->Q): Not Q but (Q if P)
17 (P/\Q)->R: If (both P and Q) then R
```

### Disjunctions in English and SL 

-   'or' expresses a disjunction.
-   'either' is an optional helper word that coordinates with 'or'.
-   'unless' is a stylistic variant of 'or'.

```{.Translate .Prop points=10}
18 P\/Q: P unless Q
19 P\/~Q: P unless not Q
20 (P->Q)\/(P<->R): Either (Q if P) or (P just in case R)
```

### Negations in English and SL

-    'not', in English, stays local: it negates the smallest sentence it is
     part of; it doesn't spread negativity to other parts of the sentence.
-    English *prefers*, where possible, to express negation by putting 'not'
     next to the main verb:
     -    'It is not raining' is preferred to 'It is not the case that it is
          raining'
-    That is not possible when negating a molecular sentence, which does not
     have a main verb (the main syntactic element is instead the main connective).
     So in these cases, we have to use 'it is not the case that'

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| P: It is pouring
| R: It is raining
| S: It is snowing
| T: I am tired of winter
:::

```{.Translate .Prop points=10}
21 ~S: It is not snowing
22 ~R/\~S: It is not raining and it is not snowing
23 ~(R/\P): It is not the case that both it is raining and it is pouring
```

### 'Neither...nor...'

'Neither...nor...' can either be translated as the negation of a disjunction, or as a conjunction of negations:

:::transl
| Neither P nor Q
| ¬(P∨Q)
| ¬P∧¬Q
:::

```{.Translate .Prop points=10}
24 ~(S\/T), ~S/\~T: It is neither snowing nor am I tired of winter
25 T/\~(R\/P), T/\(~R/\~P): I am tired of winter even though it is neither raining nor pouring.
```
:::

### Ambiguity in Sentences involving 'if' and 'not'

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| W: You watch the pot
| P: The pot will boil
:::

In Unit 03, we also learned about structural ambiguities in English.
For example, this sentence has two readings:

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that the pot will boil if you watch it.
:::

'It is not the case that' works as a prefix: it negates the sentence that
comes after it. But in this case,
there are two sentences it might be negating. It might be negating 'the pot
will boil':

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that [the pot will boil]{.wavy} if you watch it.
| ¬P if W
| W → ¬P
:::

Or it might be negating the entire conditional, 'the pot will boil if you
watch it':

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that [the pot will boil if you watch it]{.wavy}.
| ¬(P if W) 
| ¬(W → P)
:::

The first reading expresses an instance of the old adage: *a
watched pot never boils*. The second reading denies you the
superpower of boiling water just by watching it. 
The original English sentence can be read either way.

We have two tools for disambiguating English. First, we can do it the way SL
does it, augmenting English with parentheses:

::: {.transl}
| (It is not the case that the pot will boil) if you watch it.
| It is not the case that (the pot will boil if you watch it).
:::

Alternatively, we can move things around to force our preferred reading. For example, we can force the negation to negate just 'the pot will boil' by using 'not' next to the main verb instead of the prefix 'it is not the case that':

::: {.transl}
|  The pot will not boil if you watch it.
|  W → ¬P

:::

Or we can express the conditional using 'if...then...' instead of '...if...', which will move 'it is not the case that' after 'then', clearly marking it as part of the consequent:


::: {.transl}
| If you watch the pot, then it is not the case that the pot will boil.
| W → ¬P
:::

On the other hand, if we want the other reading, we can again use 'if...then...' rather than '...if...', but put 'it is not the case that' out in front of the conditional:

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that if you watch the pot, then the pot will boil.
| ¬(W → P)
:::

Note how in this last example, 'it is not the case that' can *only* negate the
entire conditional, because the entire conditional is the only *complete* sentence that it is prefixed to:

::: {.transl}
| It is not the case that [if you watch the pot, then the pot will boil]{.wavy}.
:::

The position of the 'if' blocks it from negating just 'you watch the pot':

::: {.transl}
| [It is not the case that]{.wavy} if [you watch the pot]{.wavy}, then the pot will boil.
:::

See how the 'if' gets in the way? That negation cannot "leap over" the 'if' to
negate 'you watch the pot'. And it cannot negate 'if you watch the pot',
because that isn't a complete sentence.

:::

## Ambiguities Involving Nested Conditionals

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| P: You are a Packers fan
| R: You hate the Bears
| W: You grew up in Wisconsin
:::

We now turn to new complications, not covered in Unit 03.
This sentence is structurally ambiguous:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears.
:::

This sentence contains two 'if's.  An 'if' is an antecedent marker. So this
sentence contains two antecedents. That means it contains two conditionals,
and only one of those two conditionals is the main connective. But which is it?

Focus just on the first 'if'. It marks a sentence as an antecedent. But which
sentence does it mark? Here is one possibility:

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan]{.wavy} if you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears
| If P then (if W R)
| P → (W → R)
:::

Here is the other possibility:

::: {.transl}
| If [you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin]{.wavy} you hate the Bears
| If (P if W) then R
| (W -> P) → R
:::

There are two candidate complete sentences that the first 'if' might be
marking as the antecedent. This is why the sentence is ambiguous.

We can avoid this ambiguity by expressing ourselves using canonical English:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan then (if you grew up in Wisconsin then you hate
  the Bears)
| P → (W → R)
:::

Here the parentheses clearly guide us to one reading over the other. And even without the parentheses, the pattern of 'if's and 'then's ensures an umambiguous reading:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan then if you grew up in Wisconsin then you hate the Bears
| P → (W → R)
:::

If we want the other reading, we can also achieve that in canonical English:

:::transl
| If (if you grew up in Wisconsin then you are a Packers fan) then you hate
  the Bears
| (W -> P) → R
:::

Again, we can drop the parentheses, and still avoid any ambiguity, though the doubled 'if' may raise some eyebrows:

:::transl
| If if you grew up in Wisconsin then you are a Packers fan then you hate the Bears
| (W -> P) → R
:::

Often, we don't need to include all the extra bits and pieces from canonical
English to avoid ambiguities. Consider:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan *then if* you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears.
| P → (W → R)
:::

Here the 'then if' is enough to block the other reading of our original sentence, which omitted the 'then' and just had 'if'.

On the other hand, this sentence remains ambiguous, despite the inclusion of a grammatically optional 'then':

::: transl
| If you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin *then* you
  hate the Bears.
| If [you are a Packers fan]{.wavy} if you grew up in Wisconsin *then* you
  hate the Bears.
| If [you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin]{.wavy} *then* you
  hate the Bears.
:::

Both of our readings treat 'You hate the Bears' as *a* consequent, so
marking it explicitly as a consequent with 'then' doesn't help decide between
them.

Another natural way to indicate structure in English is by using commas. Consider:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan, if you grew up in Wisconsin you hate the Bears.
| P → (W → R)
:::

Do you see how the comma after 'fan' suggests the reading we have given? Compare:

::: {.transl}
| If you are a Packers fan if you grew up in Wisconsin, you hate the Bears.
| (W -> P) → R
:::

:::

Moving that comma to after 'Wisconsin' suggests the other reading.

In English, this is just a *suggestion*. You can still read the sentences with
the commas either way, so they are still ambiguous. It's just that the commas
suggest a preference for one reading over the other.
But we want a hard and fast rule. So, for the purposes of this course, we will
suppose that, when there is an ambiguity and there is a comma, the comma
*forces* one reading over the other:

The Comma Rule
:   When a sentence would otherwise be ambiguous, a comma indicates a bigger
    structural break.

Here is a short video lecture, going over the Comma Rule:

```

<https://youtu.be/PLWI0nhHhLs>

:::

## Ambiguity in Sentences Involving 'And', 'Or', and 'If and Only If'

The comma rule helps resolve ambiguities in sentences
involving our other connectives too. For example, this sentence is ambiguous:

::: {.transl}
| People talk and rumors spread unless questions are asked.
:::

Adding a comma suggests (and, for the purposes of this class, forces) one reading over the other:

::: transl
| People talk and rumors spread, unless questions are asked
| (People talk and rumors spread) unless questions are asked
| (P ∧ R) ∨ Q
:::

And, again:

:::transl
| People talk, and rumors spread unless questions are asked
| People talk and (rumors spread unless questions are asked)
| P ∧ (R ∨ Q)
:::

Here is another example:

::: {.transl}
| She wins the prize if and only if she eats the most hot peppers and she has
  a high tolerance for spicy food.
:::

We can force the biconditional to be the main connective by putting a comma after 'prize':

::: {.transl}
| She wins the prize, if and only if she eats the most hot peppers and she has
  a high tolerance for spicy food.
| P ↔ (Q ∧ S)
:::

And we can force the conjunction to be the main connective by putting the comma after 'peppers':

:::transl
| She wins the prize if and only if she eats the most hot peppers, and she has
  a high tolerance for spicy food.
| (P ↔ Q) ∧ S
:::

Only the second reading tells us that she has a high tolerance for spicy food,
full stop, and so gives us a reason to put our money on her to win the prize.
So once again we see the practical value of studying logic: paying careful
attention to commas can save you money when gambling on eating contests at
bars.

34 (Q -> P) /\ W: You can have pudding if you eat your meat, but you're just another brick in the wall
```

## Compound Subjects and Predicates

Here is a short video lecture covering the material from this section:

::: solution
::: youtube
<https://youtu.be/EnqdZMmdgLc>
:::
:::

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| P: Desiree is imposing
| Q: Malik talked to the press
| R: Desiree talked to the press
| T: Desiree is tall
:::

```{.Translate .Prop points=10}
35 R/\Q: Desiree and Malik talked to the press
```

Notice that these two sentences are logically equivalent in English:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree and Malik talked to the press.
| Desiree talked to the press and Malik talked to the press.
:::

English craves brevity. 
So, instead of applying the *same predicate* ('talked to
the press') twice ('Desiree talked to the press' and 'Malik talked to the
press') and then conjoining those two sentences into a conjunction, we conjoin
the two subjects into a compound subject ('Desiree and Malik'), and apply the
predicate once ('Desiree and Malik talked to the press').

We do the same sort of thing when we want to apply two predicates to the same
subject:

```{.Translate .Prop points=10}
36 T/\P: Desiree is tall and imposing
```

But there is a trap. You cannot *always* tree a compound predicate or subject as equivalent to two connected sentences.
Consider what happens here:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree and Malik are in love.
| Desiree is in love and Malik is in love.
:::

'Desiree and Malik are in love' is ambigious.
On one reading, it is a simple conjunction: 'Desiree is in love and Malik is
in love'. But on the most natural reading, it means that they are *in love
with each other*, and that meaning is lost if we render it as a simple conjunction.

Again:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree and Malik are two people.
| Desiree is two people and Malik is two people.
:::

:::aside
:::youtube
https://youtu.be/iMV8btPW4wU
:::

The first sentence is true: it says that, taken together, Desiree and Malik
are two.
But the second is false: it says that each separately is two people.
I suppose the second sentence *could* be true: perhaps each of them is really
just two kids stacked in a trenchcoat.

:::

## Compound Subjects, Predicates, and Ambiguity

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky
| P: The alarm went off
| Q: Desiree is awake
| R: Malik is awake
:::

Compound subjects and predicates are nice for brevity.
But they also serve a useful *logical* purpose.
Consider:

::: {.transl}
| [Desiree and Malik are awake]{.wrap} if the alarm went off.
| P → (Q ∧ R)
:::

Do you see how the use of the compound subject, 'Desiree and Malik', forces this reading?
You cannot read the sentence instead as:

::: {.transl}
| Desiree is awake and (Malik is awake if the alarm went off).
| Q ∧ (P → R)
:::

In English, compound subjects and predicates "group more tightly" than
ordinary sentential connectives, and so provide another useful tool for
indicating structure.

:::

:::soawrapper
:::soasticky

| Q: Polly wants a cracker.

## Quantification

:::solution
::: youtube
<https://youtu.be/yDdGXYIAt4A>
:::
:::

English has several *quantificational idioms*. 
These are words like 'all', 'some', and 'none'. 
In later chapters, we will introduce *quantifiers*, 
 which are formal tools specially designed to capture the logic of these idioms.
Here we consider what we can do to capture some quantificational idioms using the tools we already have.

:::soawrapper
::: soasticky
| R: Ruth liked the movie
| S: Sonia liked the movie
| T: Clarence liked the movie

We are Ruth, Sonia, and Clarence.
:::

Suppose there are exactly three of us: Ruth, Sonia, and Clarence.
We all go to a movie, and we all liked it:

::: {.transl}
| All of us liked the movie.
:::

We can translate this into SL. 
The trick is to see that, since we are Ruth, Sonia, and Clarence, the claim
that *all of us* liked the movie can be expressed as a conjunction:

::: {.transl}
| All of us liked the movie.
| Ruth liked the movie and Sonia liked the movie and Clarence liked the movie.
| R ∧ S ∧ T
:::

Or suppose we didn't all like it:

::: transl
| Not all of us liked the movie.
| It is not the cas that (Ruth liked the movie and Sonia liked the movie and Clarence liked the movie)
| ¬(R∧S∧T)
:::

Do you see how 'not all of us' is just the negation of 'all of us'?

What if we all *didn't* like the movie?

::: transl
| All of us did not like the movie.
| Ruth and Sonia and Clarence didn't like the movie.
| Ruth didn't like the movie and Sonia didn't like the movie and Clarence didn't like the movie.
| ¬R ∧ ¬S ∧ ¬T
:::

Note the difference between saying that *not all of us* like it, and *all of
us did not* like it.
These are very different claims: maybe *not all of us* liked it, but *some of
us* did:

::: transl
| Some of us liked the movie.
| Ruth liked the movie or Sonia liked the movie or Clarence liked the movie.
| R ∨ S ∨ T
:::

Here, we treat 'some of us' as meaning 'at least one of us'.
Perhaps in English 'some of us' means 'at least *two* of us'.
We are going to ignore that wrinkle, and treat 'some' as meaning 'at least
one'.

Suppose none of us liked the movie:

::: transl
| None of us liked the movie.
:::

There are two ways to approach this. First, note that this is logically
equivalent to 'All of us did not like the movie', which we've already seen
above:

::: transl
| None of us liked the movie.
| All of us did not like the movie.
| Ruth didn't like the movie and Sonia didn't like the movie and Clarence didn't like the movie.
| ¬R ∧ ¬S ∧ ¬T
:::

Or, second, note that that 'none of us' is also equivalent to 'not some of
us':

::: transl
| None of us liked the movie.
| It is not the case that some of us liked the movie.
| It is not the case that (Ruth liked the movie or Sonia liked the movie or Clarence liked the movie).
| ¬(R ∨ S ∨ T)
:::

Finally, note that these two ways of treating 'none of us' mirror our two ways
of treating 'neither...nor...':


::: transl
| Neither Ruth nor Clarence liked the movie
| ¬R ∧ ¬T
| ¬(R ∨ T)
:::

'None of' is a kind of generalized form of 'Neither...nor...'.

:::

## Some but not All

Our translation of 'some of us' using an inclusive disjunction raises two
issues.

First, as already mentioned, you may think that 'some' implies *more than
one*. But the inclusive disjunction is true if at least one of its disjuncts
is true. So our translation doesn't capture this implication.

Second, in many situations, 'some' appears to imply 'not all'. But the
inclusive disjunction is true if all of its disjuncts are true. So our
translation doesn't capture this implication either.

Here is an example in which 'some' appears to imply 'not all':

> A: "Did any of your friends show up to your birthday party?"
>
> B: "Some of them did." 
> 
> A: "Oh! Good! How many?" 
>
> B: "Well, actually, all of them did."

B's response is misleading. Why did she say 'some' when she could have said
'all'? Was her first answer *false*?

On the other hand, consider:

> A: "How did you do on the test?"
>
> B: "I've only checked my scores on the first two questions. I got those
> correct. So I know that I got some of the questions correct."

Here B's use of 'some' clearly does not imply 'not all'. At most, it implies
that she is not in a position to *know* whether or not she got all the answers
correct.

In the 1970s, Paul Grice, a philosopher of language, provided a compelling
account of what is going on in cases like this, as part of his theory
of "Conversational Implicature". Grice thinks that in conversation, we expect
folks to be cooperative, and this means we expect them to follow a few basic
"maxims" or rules. 

One of these maxims is:

Maxim of Quantity
:   Be as informative as required.

When B *knows* that *all* her friends came to the party, but says, "Some of my
friends came to the party," she violates this maxim. What she says isn't
*false*; but it is *misleading, because we expected her to be more
informative.

On the other hand, when B said, "I got some of the problems correct," she was in no position to know whether or not she got all of them
correct, so this was as informative as she could be. In that context, her use
of 'some' instead of 'all' is not misleading, and our sense that 'some'
implies 'not all' disappears.

Implicature](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/) for more

That's a neat bit of theory about how language works.
We will continue to assume that 'some' means 'at
least one',
 and can be translated adequately using an inclusive disjunction.
