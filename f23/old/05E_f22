# Derivations with Assumptions: Exercises

:::auto-tally

## Translation

We are knee deep in derivations, but translations will come back soon,
and we will be building on what you've already learned. So, to help you retain
that knowledge, I am including a few translation exercises here.

| P: I take a deep breath 
| Q: I get real high
| R: I scream from the top of my lungs
| S: I step outside
| W: I wake in the morning

``` {.Translate .Prop points="10"}
1 R->S : I scream from the top of my lungs only if I step outside
2 W->P : I take a deep breath if I wake in the morning
3 Q/\~S : I get real high but I do not step outside
4 ~(P\/Q) : I neither take a deep breath nor get real high
5 P->(S->R) : If I take a deep breath then (if I step outside then I scream from the top of my lungs).
```

## Derivations

Complete the following derivations:

``` {.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" points=10}
6 Q->P, P->R :|-: Q->R
7 S->Q, R->~Q :|-: S->~R 
8 P->~Q, Q->P :|-: ~Q
9 P->R, ~P->R :|-: ~~R
```

If you aren't sure how to do (10), re-read the section "Unlocking the Power of
ID" in the reading.

``` {.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" points=10}
10 P->R, ~P->R :|-: R
11 R->(S->T) :|-: S->(R->T)
12 :|-: P->P 
13 ~R :|-: (Q->R)->~Q
14 :|-: (P->~P)->~P
```

Yes, (15) requires a show line inside a show line inside a show line inside a
show line. (I mention this because some students balk, afraid that they are
digging themselves too deeply into a pit, and will never be able to dig their
way out.)

``` {.ProofChecker .Prop options="guides fonts indent tabindent resize" points=10}
15 :|-: (~P->Q)->((P->R)->(~R->Q))
```

Derivations take practice. Don't forget to check out the optional
[supplementary exercises](05S) for more opportunities to practice.
