# Logic and Arguments: Exercises

## Identifying Premises and Conclusions

::: example
Waging war is always wrong, because it involves killing human beings.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
1 The conclusion of this argument is:
| *Waging war is always wrong.
| Waging war involves killing human beings.
| Killing human beings is always wrong.
| Waging war is always wrong because it involves killing human beings.
2 A premise of this argument is:
| Waging war is always wrong.
| *Waging war involves killing human beings.
| Waging war is always wrong because it involves killing human beings.

3 Rewrite the argument in standard form.
```

::: example
In 1950, the population of the world was about 2.5 billion. In 1967, the
population of the world was almost 3.5 billion. In 1980, the population of the
world was almost 5.5 billion. In 2007, it was 6.6 billion. So, the population
of the world has grown both steadily and rapidly since 1950.
:::

```

::: example
Either James died because he was shot or James died because he was hanged.
Since James didn't die because he was hanged, he died because he was shot.

| James died because he was shot.
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
8 The conclusion of this argument is: 
| Either James died because he was shot or James died because he was hanged.
| James died because he was hanged.

## Recognizing Validity and Soundness

<!-- ::: standardform -->
<!-- -  Normal is a city in Illinois. -->
<!-- -  Chicago is a city in Illinois. -->
<!-- -  Illinois is in the Midwest. -->
<!-- ::: -->

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
22 <div class="standardform"> <ul> <li>Normal is a city in Illinois.</li> <li>Chicago is a city in Illinois.</li> <li>Illinois is in the Midwest.</li> </ul> </div>
| *All of the premises of this argument are actually true.
| *The conclusion of this argument is actually true.
| This argument is valid.
| This argument is sound.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=22}
This argument has true premises and a true conclusion, but the
conclusion does not follow from the premises. More specifically, in terms
of our definition of validity, the premises could both be true, but the
conclusion false. 

To see this, imagine a possibility in which the premises are
true but the conclusion false. For example, imagine that US westward expansion ended in the early 19th
century, making the western border of Illinois the western border of the US.
So the conclusion is false. But suppose that, in this possible situation,
Chicago and Normal develop more or less the same way they actually did. So
both the premises are true.

Since the argument is not valid, it is not sound: to be sound, an argument
must both be valid AND have all true premises.
:::

<!-- ::: standardform -->
<!-- -   Normal is a city in Indiana -->
<!-- -   Chicago is a city in Indiana -->
<!-- -   Indiana is a state -->
<!-- -   Normal and Chicago are both cities in the same state -->
<!-- ::: -->

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
23 <div class="standardform"> <ul> <li>Normal is a city in Indiana</li> <li>Chicago is a city in Indiana</li> <li>Indiana is a state</li> <li>Normal and Chicago are both cities in the same state</li> </ul> </div>
| All of the premises of this argument are actually true.
| *The conclusion of this argument is actually true.
| *This argument is valid.
| This argument is sound.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=23}
This argument has a true conclusion, but its first two premises are false. But that
doesn't tell us whether or not it is valid. To figure that out, we need to
think about whether the conclusion *follows* from the premises, in the sense
defined by our definition of validity: is it *possible* for the premises to
all be true, but the conclusion false?

No, this is not possible: any possibility that makes it true that Normal and
Chicago are both cities in Indiana, and holds true the fact that Indiana is a
state, is also going to make it true that Normal and Chicago are cities in the
same state. So the argument is valid, because it is impossible for the
premises to all be true, but the conclusion false.

The argument is not sound, because it has false premises. In order for an
argument to be sound, it must both be valid AND have all true premises.
:::

<!-- ::: standardform -->
<!-- -   Biden is President -->
<!-- -   If Biden is President, a Democrat is President -->
<!-- -   A Democrat is President -->
<!-- ::: -->


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
24 <div class="standardform"> <ul> <li>Biden is President</li> <li>If Biden is President, a Democrat is President</li> <li>A Democrat is President</li> </ul> </div>
| *All of the premises of this argument are actually true.
| *The conclusion of this argument is actually true.
| *This argument is valid.
| *This argument is sound.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=24}
This argument is valid, and the premises are all true. So it is also sound.
:::

<!-- ::: standardform -->
<!-- -   Trump is President -->
<!-- -   If Trump is President, a Republican is President -->
<!-- -   A Republican is President -->
<!-- ::: -->



```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
25 <div class="standardform"> <ul> <li>Trump is President</li> <li>If Trump is President, a Republican is President</li> <li>A Republican is President</li> </ul> </div>
| All of the premises of this argument are actually true.
| The conclusion of this argument is actually true.
| *This argument is valid.
| This argument is sound.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=25}
This argument is also valid. Notice that it has the same logical form as the
previous argument, about Biden. Arguments with this logical form are valid in
virtue of their form---that is, they are formally valid. But in this case, the
first premise is false. So the argument is not sound.
:::

<!-- ::: standardform -->
<!-- -   A Democrat is President -->
<!-- -   If Biden is President, a Democrat is President -->
<!-- -   Biden is President -->
<!-- ::: -->



```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
26 <div class="standardform"> <ul> <li>A Democrat is President</li> <li>If Biden is President, a Democrat is President</li> <li>Biden is President</li> </ul> </div>
| *All of the premises of this argument are actually true.
| *The conclusion of this argument is actually true.
| This argument is valid.
| This argument is sound.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=26}
This argument is not valid. Compare its form to the form of the previous two
arguments. Those arguments had this logical form:

::: standardform
| [$P$]{.premise .nn}
| [If $P$, $Q$]{.premise .nn}
| [$Q$]{.conclusion}
:::

This argument has a similar, but importantly different, logical form:

::: standardform
| [$P$]{.premise .nn}
| [If $Q$, $P$]{.premise .nn}
| [$Q$]{.conclusion}
:::

Arguments with first form are formally valid. Arguments with this second form
are not formally valid.

Do you see why the argument is not valid? Imagine that some other Democrat had
won the primary, and then won the election. Then the premises would both still
be true, but the conclusion would be false.
:::

<!-- ::: standardform -->
<!-- -   Biden is President -->
<!-- -   Biden is not President -->
<!-- -   Grass is green -->
<!-- ::: -->


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
27 <div class="standardform"> <ul> <li>Biden is President</li> <li>Biden is not President</li> <li>Grass is green</li> </ul> </div>
| All of the premises of this argument are actually true.
| *The conclusion of this argument is actually true.
| *This argument is valid.
| This argument is sound.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=27}
This is a degenerate case of validity. To see that it is valid, think hard
about the definition of validity. Is there a possible situation in which the
premises are all true while the conclusion is false?
:::

## Thinking about the Definitions of Validity and Soundness

Recall these two definitions:

An argument is [valid]{.vocab} if and only if it is impossible for all the
premises to be true while the conclusion is false.]{.def} 

[An argument is [sound]{.vocab} if and only if it is valid and all of
its premises are actually true.

Here are some questions meant to help you think more about what these
definitions mean.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
28 Suppose an argument has a false premise. This means that:
| it is not valid.
| *it is not sound.
| none of the above.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=28}
For an argument to be *sound*, all of its premises must be true. So, if the
argument has a false premise, we know that it is not sound.

Lots of valid arguments have false premises. For example:

:::standardform
-   Normal is either in Illinois or Indiana.
-   Normal is not in Illinois.
-   Normal is in Indiana.
:::

This argument is valid, even though the second premise is false. That's
because, if the premises *were* true, the conclusion *would have to be* true
too.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
29 Suppose an argument has a true conclusion. This means that:
| it is not valid.
| it is not sound.
| *none of the above.
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=29}
An argument can have a true conclusion, even though it is neither valid nor
sound. Here is trivial an example:

:::standardform
-   Snow is white.
-   Grass is green.
-   Birds are not mammals.
:::

The conclusion of this argument is true. But the argument is not valid, and it
is not sound.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
30 Suppose an argument has true premises and a true conclusion. This means that:
| it is not valid.
| it is not sound.
| *none of the above.
