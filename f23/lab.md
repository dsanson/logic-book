Before going further, I want to introduce you to a famous logic puzzle. It involves watching a short clip from the movie  
[Labyrinth
(1986)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/){.source target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"}. In the clip, Sarah comes upon two doors, guarded by four
guards. She is given several pieces of information, and she then reasons from
those pieces of information---her premises---to a conclusion about which door
leads to the castle. As you watch, pay attention to the information she is
given, the conclusion she draws, and the reasoning she uses to reach that
conclusion. And ask yourself: Does she reason well? Is her argument valid? Does her conclusion follow
from her premises? Or does she make a mistake?
