## Welcome to PHI 112

For this course, we will be using a free website called \"Carnap\". The
readings and assignments are all hosted there. So your first task is to
create an account on Carnap, using the link below. **BEFORE CLICKING
THAT LINK** please read this:

1.   On Carnap, use your ULID (e.g., \'rredbird\'). Do **not** use your UID (e.g.,
\'123456789\').

## Step-by-step instructions {#steps}

1.  If you don't have a Google account, [create one for
    free](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}

2.  Follow this link to create an account on Carnap and "enroll" in this
    course:
    [https://carnap.io/enroll/ISU_112_FALL_2023](https://carnap.io/enroll/ISU_112_FALL_2023){.uri
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

    a.  Use your preferred name and your ULID (e.g., 'rredbird').
    b.  Our course---ISU_112_FALL_2023---should be automatically
        selected. But in some cases, you may need to select it from a
        drop-down menu.

3.  If you already have an account on Carnap and want to re-use it, you
    need to login to Carnap using your old account and "Change
    Enrollment". You should be able to do this by clicking the
    enrollment link above, and logging in with the the same google
    account you used previously. Or, you can go to your [User
    page](https://carnap.io/user){target="_blank" rel="noopener"},
    scroll to the bottom of the page, and click on the "Unenroll"
    button. This will remove you from the previous class. You can then
    click on the "Edit" button, and enroll in this class, by choosing it
    from the drop-down menu.
