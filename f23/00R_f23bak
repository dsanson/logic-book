I teach two sections of this course. Please attend the section in which you
are enrolled.

## Course Description

This is a class in formal logic. We cover propositional logic and first-order
quantification, with a focus on translation and natural deduction.

But what does that even mean?

*Logic* is the study of *reasoning*: what makes it good, and what makes it
bad. It is the study of the *laws* of reasoning itself, not the *psychology*
of reasoning. In that way, it is like math, which studies the *laws* of
arithmetic, not the *psychological processes* by which we add and subtract.

There are different approaches to logic. In this class, our approach will be
to develop an account of *logical form*, and which logical forms are good, and
which bad. For example, this is a good logical form, called *Modus Ponens*:

:::standardform
-   If P is true, then Q is true. 
-   P is true. 
-   Q is true.
:::

(The '∴' symbol means 'therefore', and marks the last line as the *conclusion*,
meant to *follow* from the two *premises* above it. More on all that later.)
By contrast, this is a bad logical form, called *Affirming the Consequent*:

:::standardform
-   If P is true, then Q is true. 
-   Q is true.
-   P is true. 
:::

What does it mean to say that a logical form is good or bad, and why do we say
that Modus Ponens is good, and Affirming the Consequent is bad? That's the
topic of the first chapter of our book.

Modus Ponens and Affirming the Consequent are *sentential* or *propositional*
forms. The 'P's and 'Q's in them stand for declarative sentences or
*propositions*. We can combine these using *sentential connectives*, like
'if...then...' and 'either...or...'. In this way, we can generate lots of
sentential argument forms, and ask which are good, which bad. This is
*Propositional Logic (PL)*, aka *Sentential Logic*, the topic of the first
two-thirds of this course.

For the last third of the course, we turn to consider *Quantificational Logic*. Here is an example of a *good* logical form in *QL*, called *Universal Instantiation*:

:::standardform
-   All dogs go to heaven.
-   If Fido is a dog, then Fido goes to heaven.
:::

Here is an example of a *bad* logical form, called *Existential Instantiation*:

:::standardform
-   Some dogs go to heaven.
-   Garfield is a dog who goes to heaven.
:::

There are different kinds of formal logic classes. Classes in *Mathematical
Logic* or *Metalogic* briefly introduce the systems of propositional and
quantificational logic, and then proceed to prove things about those systems,
and explore alternative ways in which those systems might be constructed. This
class is not like that. Our focus will be working within the systems, to get a
feel for how they work, and how they might be applied to everyday reasoning.

We will use an artificial language to describe and display logical forms. 
Sentences in this langauge look like formulas from algebra. Here are some examples:

::: example
-   P → (Q ∧ R), which means *If P, then both Q and R*
-   ∀x∃y(F(x) ↔ G(y)), which means *For every x, some y is such that x is F if and only if y is G*
:::

In the short course description, I said that will focus on translation and
natural deduction. By "translation", I meant translating sentences in English
into sentences in our artificial language, a process that involves both
understanding our artificial language, and thinking about the logical forms of
English sentences.

Natural deduction is a way of representing and reconstructing complex chains
of reasoning, of the sort you might encounter in a mathematical proof or a
work of philosophy. There are several systems that have been designed for
doing this. The short course description mentions the system we will be using.
But that is probably only meaningful to other logic professors.

This class has one foot in mathematics, and one foot in language. If you think
of yourself as good at math but bad at language, or bad at language but good
at math, you will probably find parts of this class easy, and parts hard. Most
students report that the class makes their brain hurt in one way or another.
Please understand: this is a *good* thing. It means your brain is being
rewired, and you are gaining new powers.

One of the secrets to those new powers: the sharp distinction between math and
language is not as real as you think. For that matter, neither is the sharp
distinction between the sciences and the humanities. The study of logic cuts
across the first, just as the study of philosophy cuts across the second. This
class is meant to rewire your brain, and make you *think* in a new way, that
does not respect such distinctions. This new way of thinking applies to
anything and everything you ever might think about.

## Aside: About this document

This is the course syllabus, but is is also a tutorial, introducing you to the
nuts and bolts of course assignments. Completing this unit counts toward your
course grade.

All units, including this one, include questions that you need to answer or
exercises that you need to complete, as you read. For example, you need to
answer this multiple choice question now. For this one, try giving the *wrong* answer to see what happens (don't worry, you won't lose any points):

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
1 This unit is
|*a tutorial, but also the syllabus, and also counts for course credit.
|an optional introduction with sample questions that don't actually count for course credit.
```

If you selected the wrong answer, you were told so, and asked to try again.
Questions and exercises in the reading will *always* be like this: you cannot submit an incorrect answer. If you make a mistake, you will be asked to try again. You can keep trying until you get it right.

I can also include open-ended short response questions, like this:

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=10}
3 Why are you taking this class? What do you hope to get out of it?
```

::: {.reaction .correct ex="3"}
Sometimes, when you submit an answer to a question, a reaction box like this
will open, giving you a bit of feedback or advice.
:::

For short response questions like (3), you get full credit for submitting
*something*. I will typically use such questions to encourage you to stop and
think: the value lies in your making the attempt, not in whether or not you
get it right.

It is trivial to complete single-answer multiple choice questions by brute
force: just try each possibility until you get the right one. If you do that,
you will get the points without bothering to think or process the information.
But that is a bad idea. The reading is here to help you learn what you need to
learn to do well on the mastery checks, and if you cannot pass the mastery checks,
the points you earn on the reading are worth nothing. Still, I understand the temptation. So I will often give you multiple choice
questions with more than one correct answer. For these, you have to select
*all* the correct answers. This makes it much more tedious to brute force the answers:

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
2 The kinds of questions that are asked in this unit include (select all correct answers):
| *multiple choice questions with one correct answer
| *multiple choice questions with several correct answers, like this one
| CAPTCHAs designed to verify that you are human
| *open-ended short response questions
```

## Course design and expectations

This class is *flipped*. I will not lecture. I expect you to read and work
outside of class, and make an effort to figure things out for yourself. In
class, I will help you figure out whatever you couldn't figure out on your
own.

It is also *self-paced*. There are some deadlines. But ultimately, your grade
depends on *how far you get*, and it is up to you to maintain a pace that
allows you to succeed.

This will likely make you *uncomfortable*. Trying to figure out how to do
something by reading about it *feels harder* than having someone talk you
through it. But experience shows that what *feels* better *works* worse. I can
give you a lecture, showing you how to do everything, and you will feel like
you understood. But when you sit down to complete the problems, that feeling
will evaporate, and you will be lost.

The best way to learn is to *try*, *fail*, *get help*, and
*try again*. But nobody likes failing, and many of us don't like asking for help either.
Better if someone explains it all first without waiting for you to ask, so you can succeed on your first try, and avoid failing. If only that worked.

Instead, this class is designed to make you try first, and maximizing your
chances to try, fail, get help, and try again.

But this means that you **cannot approach this class passively**. If you just sit waiting for something to happen, nothing will happen, and you will fall behind. Instead, you need to **jump in** and start **trying** to understand the reading and solve the problems. Give yourself permission to fail: it is no big deal, and all part of the process of figuring things out. And **ask me for help**. I am here, ready and eager to offer assistance!

**Trying early and often** means reading and trying *before* class, not
*during* class. Class is not *study hall*, where you come to do your reading.
Class is where you come to vent your frustration at whatever it is that you
didn't understand in the reading, or whatever problems you cannot solve,
despite having spent time trying to figure them out.

**Giving yourself permission to fail** means not just being willing to make
mistakes, but being willing to learn from those mistakes. Each unit is
followed by a *mastery check*. This is a mini test, but if you fail it, that's
okay: you can retake it, and retake it again, and again, if needed. What is
important is that you figure out *how to learn* from your failure. What went
wrong, and why? What was it that you didn't understand? What can you do to
understand that better, and avoid similar mistakes on future retakes? There
are always students who refuse to do this: they fail, chalk it up to bad luck,
and try to bulldoze their way through the mastery check, asking for retake
after retake, and failing again and again. That is frustrating and
demoralizing. Don't do it.

**Asking for help** means reaching out to me or to your classmates. Don't
suffer in silence. Nobody expects you to learn logic on your own. We are in
this together, and, most importantly, I am here to help. That might involve
spending some one-on-one time in class, or in office hours, working through
some problems. It might involve me giving you an impromptu mini-lecture,
helping you grasp some key concept or process that you couldn't figure out
from the reading. This is what I am here for! But for it to work well, you
need to communicate when you are struggling, so we can figure out how to help.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
4 For this course, you are expected
| *to do the reading before class, and come to class confused
| to wait and only attempt problems and exercises after the material has been covered in class
| *to pay attention when things go wrong or you make mistakes, and figure out what you didn't understand
| to brute-force your way through reading, mastery checks, and retakes, grinding your way to course credits.
```

## Grades

When it comes to your grade, what matters is how much and how well you learn
in the end. That is, your grade will be determined by *how many* units you *complete or
master* by the end of the term, in accordance with the following chart:


   Course Grade                        Units Complete
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        A         at least 16 units complete, at least 10 of which are both complete and mastered
        B         at least 14 units completed, at least 8 of which are both complete and mastered
        C         at least 10 units complete
        D         at least 8 units complete

For a unit to count as *complete*, you need to answer all the reading questions correctly, and score 60% or higher on the mastery check. For a unit to count as *both complete and mastered*, you need to answer all the reading questions correctly, and score 80% or higher on the mastery check:

Complete
:    Reading = 100% and Mastery check ≥ 60%

Both Complete and Mastered
:    Reading = 100% and Mastery check ≥ 80%

A unit is *incomplete* if you have not answered all the reading questions correctly, or if your score on the mastery check is below 60%:

Incomplete
:    Reading < 100% or Mastery check < 60%

You don't get *any* credit for incomplete units. The reading questions are formative: you have to do them, and they are meant to help you learn the material. The mastery checks are summative: they test whether or not you have actually learned the material.

The course is designed to be completed linearly: Unit 1, followed by Unit 2, followed by Unit 3, and so on. But in principle, what matters is *how many* units you complete, not which ones. However, several
key units are **required**, as per this table:

   Course Grade           Required units
  -------------- ---------------------------------
        A         Must complete units 04,05,09,10
        B          Must complete units 04,05,09
        C            Must complete units 04,05

Predictably, these are the units are the ones that experience shows students are most tempted to avoid.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
5 Select all true claims from the list below:
| *To complete a unit, I need to get 100% on the reading questions and get 60% or above on the mastery check
| *If a unit is mastered and complete, it is also complete
| *It is possible to get a C without mastering any units
| It is possible to get a D without completing any units, as long as I earn a lot of points in the reading
| If I complete enough other units, I can get a C in this class without completing unit 04
| *I can earn a B in this class without both mastering and completing unit 04
| I can earn a B in this class without completing unit 04
| *If I complete enough other units, I can pass this class without completing this unit, unit 00
```

## Mastery checks

A mastery check is a short low-stakes assessment, consisting of 3 to 6
problems. Some mastery checks are online and machine graded. But some are
completed on paper in-class, and graded by hand.

You are **not allowed to collaborate** on mastery checks. A mastery check is
something you do on your own, to prove, both to me and to yourself, that you
have learned the material from that unit. Collaboration on mastery checks is
cheating and grounds for disciplinary action.

When you are ready to attempt an online mastery check, send me a DM on
GroupMe, and I will send you a link with a password. **This link is for your
use alone. Do not share this link or password with other students.** For
in-class mastery checks, ask in class. You cannot request more than one
in-class mastery check in the same period, and you cannot request an in-class
mastery check if there are less than 15 minutes left in the class period.

Before you *retake* a mastery check, I will seek some reassurance that you understand what went wrong on your previous attempt. Ideally, we will have a chance to go over your previous attempt together, and discuss your mistakes.
Typically, the individual problems on each mastery check are aligned, so for your retake, you only
need to complete the problems you got wrong on your previous attempts.

There are three limits on retakes:

1.  There is a mandatory waiting period between attempts: you cannot take or
    retake the same mastery check twice in one day.
2.  You are only allowed two *retakes* total each week: not two per unit, but
    two across all units.
3.  Many of the units have *expiration dates*. After the expiration date, you can no longer attempt the mastery check for a unit until finals week.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
6 Select all and only the true claims from this list:
| It is okay to collaborate on mastery checks, as long as the final answer is your own.
| If you fail a mastery check, you can retake it again that same day
| You are allowed more than two retakes each week, as long as they are spread across different units
| If a friend needs a link to retake and hasn't gotten a response from the professor, you can help out by sharing a retake link with them
```

## Due Dates and Expiration Dates

Many of the units have due dates. If you can get these units both completed
and mastered by their due dates, you should have no trouble earning a B in the
course. There is no penalty for work turned in past the due date. Being
"behind" just means that you are falling off pace, in danger of earning a C or
lower in the course.

Some of the units also have *expiration dates*. Once a unit has expired, you
can still complete the reading, but you have to wait until finals week to
attempt its mastery check. If you are missing expiration dates, then you are
in serious danger of failing the course.

All online submissions are frozen on the last day of classes, December 8th, at
5pm. I am announcing this deadline now. You are responsible for meeting it. It
will not be extended. After this deadline, it is no longer possible to submit
reading questions, and so no longer possible to get credit for any unit for
which you have completed the reading. But you do get one last chance to
complete mastery checks, in-person, during our final exam period.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
7 Select all and only the true claims from this list:
| *After a unit has expired, you can still complete the reading exercises.
| If you turn in each unit before its due date, you are on pace to get an A in this course.
| It is still possible to get credit for reading exercises by submitting them during finals week.
| *Many students struggle to stay on track with this course, because it is self-paced
```

## Final Exam

This class does not have a final exam. Your grade is based upon how many units
you complete and how many you both complete and master, as explained above.

During the scheduled final exam period, everyone has one last chance to take or retake mastery checks. This includes mastery checks for expired units. It does not include mastery checks for units for which you have not completed the reading.

These mastery checks will all be on paper, not online.

``` {.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points="10"}
8 Select all and only the true claims:
| It is okay to share online mastery check links to help out a friend
| If you haven't completed the reading for a unit by December 8th, you can still complete that unit by taking the mastery check during Finals Week
| *During Finals Week, you can take or retake a mastery check from an expired unit.
| During Finals Week, it is still possible to take or retake online mastery checks for some units.
```

## Collaboration Units

Genuine engagement, participation, and collaboration are hard to measure.
Schemes that "bean count" participation tend to motivate folks just to do
the bare minimum, which can be counterproductive.

One thing that is easy to measure is attendance. Attendance is 
a necessary but not sufficient condition for engagement,
participation, and collaboration. I hope that, if I can get you to attend, I
can get you engage and collaborate. It may sound cheesy, but I want us to come
to together into a friendly and supportive community of folks working together
to learn logic. Trust me, learning logic is easier when you are part of such a
community.

For each class you attend, you earn 10 "collaboration points". Your first 100
collaboration points earn you one complete collaboration unit. Your second 100
collaboration points earn you a second complete collaboration unit. These
count toward your total complete units, for the purpose of calculating your
course grade. (No, there is no way to "master" these units.)

I recognize that there are legitimate reasons to miss class. We have 30 class
meetings throughout the term. You can miss several classes and still earn both
collaboration units.

Every term, I have students who blow off classes, and then come back, hoping
to secure a passing grade. If only they had come to class, they would have had
a couple of collaboration units to help bolster their grade.

## Drop-In Office Hours

My drop-in office hours are times that I set aside, so that students can drop
in and ask for help. You do not need to make an appointment. You can just
drop-in. If you cannot make my drop-in office hours, ask for an appointment.

You can also use drop-in office hours to take or retake an in-class only mastery check.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
9 Drop-in office hours are
| by appointment only
| a time for me to be alone in my office without being bothered by students
| *times when you can drop by and ask for help
| *times when you can drop by without an appointment
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
10 The best way to contact me about this course is
| via shortwave radio
| *via GroupMe
| via email
```

:::{.reaction .incorrect ex=10}
The answer to question 10 can be found near the beginning of the syllabus, if
you missed it the first time through.

## Common Challenges and Barriers to Success

Many students arrive in this class who have an unhappy history with math. If
that is you, I see you and you are not alone.

There is no getting around the fact that this class is in part a math class.
For some of you, it will trigger old anxieties and open old wounds.

But please understand:

-   Formal logic is its own thing! This class does not presuppose or build
    upon high school algebra in any way.
-   The formal logic we will be doing really is objectively *much simpler*
    than high school algebra.
-   Many people who are "bad at math" turn out to be great at logic. That
    might include you! Give it a chance on its own terms.

In this class, we will be thinking about language in a math-y way, and
thinking about math in a language-y way. Most of us were taught to treat these
as separate ways of thinking, so you might find this weird. But once you get
the hang of it, it is kind of neat.

Typically, students who identify as "good with language" but "bad at math"
 struggle with the "math-y" bits, while
students who identify as "good at math" but "bad with language"
 struggle with the "language-y" bits.
Even students who think of themselves as good at both
 often still struggle when asked to put the two together.

Finally, this is not a course in abstract theory, and it is not a class that
asks you to memorize and regurgitate facts.
It is a course that asks you to learn *how* to solve different kinds of
problems. Learning *how* to do something takes *practice*, and practice takes
*time*. The course is designed to maximize your opportunities to practice,
both inside and outside of class,
and maximize your opportunities to get help as you practice.
But I cannot maximize your *time*: that is a limited resource that you will
need to manage.


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection points=10}
11 This class might be challenging for you because
| *it combines both mathematics and language
| it will be taught entirely in French 
| it is a course in abstract theory
| *learning how to solve the problems takes practice, and practice takes time
```

:::{.reaction .correct ex=11}
C'est la seule partie de ce cours qui est en français.

## Carnap.io

The readings and assignments for this course are all on Carnap.io. Carnap is a
tool for automatic machine grading of complicated logic problems. It is free,
but you will need a Google account to sign in. If you are reading this, presumably you
have already succeeded at doing this!

For the record: to enroll in Carnap, follow this link:

-   <https://carnap.io/enroll/ISU_112_FALL_2023>

-   If you don't already have a Google account, you can [create one for
    free](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp).
-   When you create your account on Carnap, you will be asked for your name
    and your University ID.
    -   Use your preferred name. If that\'s different from the name that will
        show up on my official roster, I'll figure it out.
    -   For your University ID, use your **ULID**, not your **UID**. Your ULID
        is the first part of your ISU email address. Your UID is your nine
        digit student ID number.

If you already have an account on Carnap from a previous course, you need to
change the course you are enrolled in, so you are enrolled in this course, not
your old course. Otherwise you won't get credit for any of your work.

## Canvas

Carnap.io does not support my grading scheme. Neither does Canvas. Neither did our old LMS, Reggienet. 

You can track your progress on individual assignments on Carnap by looking at
the progress bar at the top of each assignment. You should see this bar now,
at the top of this page. If you click on that bar, you can see more useful
information about this assignment.

You can also go to your [User Page](https://carnap.io/user) on Carnap, where
you can find a list of assignments, and, if you scroll down, a list of each
problem that you have submitted for each assignment.

For an overview of your progress through the course, I plan to use the Canvas
gradebook. This is my first time doing this with Canvas, so the ride may be a
bit bumpy at first. Once it is up and running, you will be able to find a
breakdown of how many units you have completed, how many you have completed
and mastered, and a tally of your collaboration points.

I am hoping that I can figure out how to make this all get updated
automatically, from Carnap.io to Canvas, at least once a day. For now, it will
be done manually, and I will try to do it at least once a week.

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice points=10}
12 The Canvas gradebook
| will automatically stay in sync with Carnap, so if my scores don't show up on the Canvas gradebook immediately, something has gone wrong.
| *needs to be updated manually, so newly completed work will not show up immediately on Canvas.
```

## Accommodations

Any student needing to arrange a reasonable accommodation for a
documented disability should contact Student Access and Accommodation
Services at 350 Fell Hall, 309-438-5853,
<http://studentaccess.illinoisstate.edu>.

Really, if there is *anything* reasonable that you think I might be able to do
that would make things work better for you, whether the relevant issue is
"documented" or not, talk to me.

Also, Carnap.io is a work in progress. I believe it is *relatively*
accessible, when compared to the alternatives, but please let me know about
any specific accessibility issues you encounter. Some I might be able to fix
myself. Others I can report upstream to the developers.

## Other Sources of Support 

Life at college can get complicated. If you're feeling stressed, overwhelmed,
lost, anxious, depressed or are struggling with personal issues, do not
hesitate to call or visit Student Counseling Services (SCS). These services
are free and completely confidential. SCS is located at 320 Student Services
Building, (309) 438-3655.

If you are worried about a friend and don't know how to help, you can call SCS
and ask to speak to a counselor. The Kognito simulation, available through
SCS's webpage, can also help you learn how to assist your friend in connecting
to services.

Also, it's hard to learn if you're hungry or couch-surfing. If you are having
difficulty affording groceries, accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or
securing a safe and stable place to live, help may be available. I urge you to
contact the Dean of Students Office to learn more.

The School Street Food Pantry offers free food to any students dealing with
food insecurity. It is located inside Normal First United Methodist Church at
211 N. School St., just north of Milner Library, and is open Fridays from 4-6
p.m. I usually have a few basic snacks in my office, too, which I'm happy to
share.

## Academic Misconduct

You are expected to be honest in all academic work, consistent with the
academic integrity policy as outlined in the Code of Student Conduct and any
additional syllabus language. All work is to be appropriately cited when it is
borrowed, directly or indirectly, from another source. Unauthorized and/or
unacknowledged collaboration on any work, or the presentation of someone
else's work, is plagiarism.

Content generated by an Artificial Intelligence third-party service or site
(AI-generated content) without proper attribution or authorization is another
form of plagiarism. If you are unsure about whether something may be
plagiarism or another form of academic dishonesty, please reach out to me to
discuss it as soon as possible. Any allegation of academic dishonesty may be
referred to Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean
of Students Office, for possible review. If found responsible for academic
dishonesty, a grade penalty can also be applied.
