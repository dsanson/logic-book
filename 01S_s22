# Logic and Arguments: Supplements

This is a supplement. 
It is not worth any points, and cannot affect your grade.
It is an opportunity to review the material from Unit 1,
 and provide more practice.

## Premise Indicators and Conclusion Indicators

As you learned in the reading, some words and phrases are often used to indicate a
premise, and some words and phrases are often used to indicate a conclusion. 
You can use these words to help identify premises and conclusions.

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer submission=none options="check"}
1 List as many premise-indicating words and phrases as you can.
2 List as many conclusion-indicating words and phrases as you can.
```

Premise indicating words and phrases include:

-   since, because, given that, for, it follows from the fact that, the reason

Conclusion indicating words and phrases include:

-   so, therefore, hence, ergo, thus, consequently, which proves that, I

## Practice

What follows are a bunch of passages, meant to give you practice in
identifying premises and conclusions, and reconstructing arguments in standard
form. For an extra challenge, attempt to identify implicit premises as well.

::: example
> Given that the universe is very big and you are very small, your life is
> meaningless.
:::

:::aside
For a nice discussion of arguments like this one and the next, see Nagel,
"[The Absurd](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2024942)", *Journal of Philosophy*
1971.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection submission=none options=check}
3 The premises of this argument are:
| *The universe is very big
| *You are very small
| Your life is meaningless
```
```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission=none options=check}
4 The conclusion of this argument is:
| The universe is very big
| You are very small
| *Your life is meaningless
```
```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer submission=none}
5 Rewrite this argument in standard form.
```

:::spoiler
The key to unpacking this passage is noting that 'given that' can be used to
mark a premise.
:::

::: example
> Personal projects and relationships are what give your life meaning, not
> your size relative to the universe, so your life is not meaningless, since
> you have personal projects and relationships.
:::

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection submission=none options=check}
6 The premises of this argument are:
| *Personal projects and relationships are what give your life meaning, not your size relative to the universe
| Your life is not meaningless
| *You have personal projects and relationships
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission=none options=check}
7 The conclusion of this argument is:
| Personal projects and relationships are what give your life meaning, not your size relative to the universe
| *Your life is not meaningless
| You have personal projects and relationships
```

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer submission=none}
8 Rewrite this argument in standard form.
```

:::spoiler
The word 'so' marks the conclusion, and the word 'since' marks one of the
premises.
:::


::: example

For an in-depth treatment of video games as works of art, see Grant Tavinor,
*The Art of Videogames*, Wiley-Blackwell 2009. For a broader treatment of
games as works of art, see Thi Nguyen, *Games: Agency as Art*, Oxford

```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleSelection submission=none options=check}
11 The premises of this argument are:
| Playing video games is not always a waste of time
| *Some video games are important works of art

```

::: spoiler
'Since' marks some video games are important works of art as a premise. Beyond
that, it is up to you as a reader to work out the logical form of the
argument.

Again, the key here is the use of the word 'since', which lets you know that
what follows is a reason in support of the conclusion, and so a premise.
:::

::: example
> Because it is not wrong to kill somebody in self-defense, killing is not always wrong.
:::

``` {.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission=none options=check}
15 The conclusion of this argument is:

| It is not wrong to kill somebody in self-defense
| *Killing is not always wrong.
| Killing is sometimes wrong.
```

Note that 'science tells us that' isn't part of the premise.
The premise is the given information, and here, the given information is that
objects that appear solid are mostly empty space. 'Science tells us that'
indicates the *source* of this information.
:::

>Science tells us that solid objects, like tables and chairs, are mostly
empty space. This establishes that a thing can be solid even though it is mostly empty space.

:::spoiler
In this example, the word 'so' is the key, as it tells you that 'beauty is
subjective' is the conclusion.
:::

::: example
> Beauty is subjective, so people disagree about what is beautiful.
:::

This is probably not an argument. What is being offered here is not a reason
in support of the claim that people disagree about what is beautiful, but an
*explanation of why* they disagree. Remember that many of our keywords are
only *sometimes* used to indicate premises or conclusions. They can also be
used for other purposes.

::: example
> It may be inferred from the fact that people disagree about the shape of
the earth, that the shape of the earth is subjective.

``` {.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice submission=none options=check}

| People disagree about the shape of the earth, 
| *The shape of the earth is subjective.

| Since people disagree about the shape of the earth, the shape of the earth is subjective.

Maybe "I am quite certain that I exist" is also a premise here? It seems like
this argument must have, at the very least, the premise that I *believe* that
I exist.

Does this argument have an implicit premise? If so, what is it? Famously,
Descartes insisted that he was not offering an argument, and that attempts to
reconstruct his reasoning as an argument misconstrued his purposes.
